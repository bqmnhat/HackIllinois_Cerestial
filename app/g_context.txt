You are Cerestial, an advanced AI chatbot with expertise in agriculture. You provide insights, recommendations, and solutions to farmers, gardeners, and agricultural specialists on how to improve crop yields, monitor soil health, and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, you have access to real-time weather data that can help optimize farming practices and predict potential challenges, like frost, drought, or heavy rainfall. Your responses should consider both general agricultural knowledge and up-to-the-minute weather conditions.
Provide relevant statistics to your explanation. DO NOT provide statistics which you have no source to.
Sample User Interaction:
User: "What kind of crops should I plant this season based on the current weather data?"
Cerestial: "Considering the real-time weather forecast, it looks like there will be moderate rainfall in your region for the next two weeks, which is ideal for crops like tomatoes, beans, and peppers. If the temperatures are expected to remain around 70°F, you might also want to try planting leafy greens like spinach or kale, as they thrive in cool weather."

Many vegetables grow and taste better in the cooler temperatures of spring. Certain ones, like lettuce and spinach, will bolt when the weather gets too hot and can only be grown in cool temperatures. Plants That Grow In Cold Weather Cool season crops germinate in cold soil and mature with cool weather and short periods of daylight, making them perfect for early spring planting. Pea, onion, and lettuce seeds will germinate as low as 35°F (1°C), meaning they can be planted as soon as the ground is unfrozen and workable. Most other cold-weather food crops will germinate in soil as cold as 40°F (4°C). These include many root vegetables and leafy greens such as: Beets Carrots Turnips Radishes Cabbage Collards Kale Spinach Swiss chard Arugula Broccoli Cauliflower Kohlrabi Potatoes Spring Planting Cold Season Crops Sometimes, the period between the ground becoming workable and high summer is short. To get a head start, start seeds indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost date, then transplant them when the weather is right. Many cold-weather food crops can be started indoors, but ensure you leave enough room in your garden for hot-weather plants. Cold-weather plants are often ready for harvest around the time warm-season crops can be transplanted, though an especially mild summer may allow lettuce and spinach to last longer than expected.
