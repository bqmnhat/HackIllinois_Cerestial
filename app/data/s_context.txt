Yet, because the crop is so sensitive to climate and field conditions, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for how to grow corn. Growing it is still a no-brainer, though, when put in context. With today’s readily available technologies, crop producers can quickly adjust the process of growing corn for maximum yields by keeping an eye on various factors in the field, such as the current and predicted weather, soil moisture data, potential threats including weeds and pests, and much more. ## Table Of Contents * What Are the Best Corn Growing Conditions? * Soil Requirements for Corn Plants * When to Plant and Grow Corn * Best Practices for Planting Corn * Further Crop Maintenance Procedures * Corn Growth Timeline * Tips for Proper Harvesting Hide ## What Climate And Growing Conditions Does Corn Require? When thinking about growing conditions for corn, one of the first concerns should be: “What temperature does corn need to grow?” It is a true summer type of crop, thus it can only flourish in warm weather. Ideal temperatures for crop development shift during the day and the growing season. During the daytime, an optimal corn growing temperature ranges from 77 to 91°F (25 to 33°C), whereas at night, 62 to 74°F (17 to 23°C) is recommended. **How much sun does corn need to grow?** A minimum of 6–8 hours of sunlight every day is the common growing corn plant light requirement. It is needed to grow corn away from any large trees that could cast shadows and plant tall varieties to the north or east of your field so that your shorter plants can get enough sun during the day. Temperatures **between 68 and 73°F (20–22°C)** are the sweet spot for crop development throughout the whole growing season Neild, R. E., Newman, J. E. (1988). National Corn Handbook. Growing Season Characteristics and Requirements in the Corn Belt. Purdue University, Cooperative Extension Service.. If the soil is sufficiently moist, however, corn can grow in heat as high as 100°F (38°C). By sufficient moisture, we mean a consistent supply of mild, periodic precipitation or irrigation across the entire field, totaling not less than 15” (38 cm) during the growing season. The ideal amount of **rainfall for a high-yield growing season is between 18 and 20” (45 and 50 cm).** Since corn requires specific climatic conditions to flourish, it is crucial to pick the right fields for growing the crop. This is vital in order to lessen the burden of additional crop care expenses during the corn growing season. It’s simple to **pick the ideal corn-growing areas** with the help of EOSDA Crop Monitoring. When making this choice, you can’t beat having access to the platform’s historical weather records that include temperature and precipitation readings for any field. Historical temperature graphs on EOSDA Crop Monitoring.Historical precipitation graphs on EOSDA Crop Monitoring. ## What Type Of Soil Does Corn Grow Best In? Corn plants are particular about the soil they grow in; therefore, understanding the type of soil and its overall condition is crucial for a healthy harvest. If you want to maximize your yield, grow your **early varieties in sand or loam and your late ones in silty or clayey types of soil Sideman, B. (2016, June). Growing Sweet Corn. University of New Hampshire (UNH) Cooperative Extension.**. Corn, like many other vegetables, prefers acidic and neutral soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Thus, it is advised to conduct soil testing to ascertain that the soil’s pH is right for growing crops. The soil’s moisture and efficient drainage are also important factors because of the growing plant’s thirsty nature. Also, corn is a heavy feeder, particularly when it comes to nitrogen, so rich soil is essential for the growth of corn. It grows well in places where soil-improving crops like beans, alfalfa, vetch, or clover were cultivated the previous season. Adding organic matter to the soil, such as compost, manure, sawdust, and grass clippings, can also improve its quality and drainage for successful corn growing, especially in areas with thick clay soil. **How deep do corn roots grow?** Although a plant’s roots can penetrate as deep as 1.5 meters (5 feet), they usually grow in the top 3 feet (90 cm). Because of this, plants commonly have relatively shallow roots, but under the right conditions, roots can grow deeper. Corn seeds have an easier time germinating in light soils because they warm up more rapidly than heavy ones. Make sure the **soil temperature is between 60 and 65°F (16–18°C) before you sow the seeds.** They won’t germinate well if it’s not warm enough. Soil solarization, which involves covering the soil with black plastic, can speed up the warming process in cold regions and help you start growing crops just in time. ## When Is The Best Time To Plant And Grow Corn? Because of their susceptibility to frost damage, crops that are planted too early often fail. For your own protection, **wait at least two to three weeks following the final spring frost** date before planting corn. Figuring out when it is safe to plant is a breeze with the help of EOSDA Crop Monitoring’s **historical data on temperature anomalies in the field and the weather forecast for the next 14 days.** If you have a reliable weather forecast, you can always get the corn planting season started on time and get the most out of your crops. Weather forecast in EOSDA Crop Monitoring for planting crops showing spring frosty nights. In many regions of the United States, late March or early April is the best time to plant corn. Yet, consider the weather’s moisture levels while picking when to plant corn. March and early April are often wetter than other months, making them too damp for successful corn plant growing. Most of the time, planting between April 20 and May 10 gives the highest germination rates and crop yields. **Is corn easy to grow?** This crop may be easy to grow, but it needs a lot of room to flourish. Growing plants of this height requires a sheltered spot because of their susceptibility to the wind. Frost can also damage the growing crop, which must be protected at all costs. Corn needs 60–100 days without frost throughout its growing season, so it is still important to plant it early. Planting at a later time requires putting the seeds at a depth of two inches (5 cm) to prevent them from drying out. ## EOSDA Crop Monitoring Access high-resolution satellite images to ensure effective fields management! try now ## How To Plant Corn Growers who want their crop to be as fruitful as possible should take the following steps to **prepare the soil before planting corn** : * strip the ground bare of vegetation; * plow the field deeply; * amend the soil with limestone; * mix in some cured manure to boost soil fertility and structural integrity; * rotavate the field; * set up the drains. Planting corn seeds in the ground can be done either by hand or with the aid of a mechanical planter. Farm workers shouldn’t use fast planting speeds that cause the planter to bounce. This way, the depth and emergence of the seeds will be even throughout the field. Optimal plant density depends on a wide range of variables, including soil type, irrigation, hybrids used, and field management practices. If you consistently space your plants and allow for even emergence, you’ll get the best possible harvest. **How far apart to plant corn?** A standard rule of thumb for corn plant spacing is to leave 1 foot (30 cm) between plants inside a row and 3 feet (90 cm) between rows Mohansingh, R. (2013, May). How To Grow Field Corn. Extension Training and Information Services Division, Ministry of Food Production of Trinidad and Tobago.. The best way to plant corn implies putting two seeds in each hole and covering them with a thin soil layer. How deep to plant corn seeds? The depth of the hole should be between 0.8 and 1.2” (2 and 3 cm). If seeds are planted too shallow, they may have a decreased chance of growing strong nodal roots. In dry soils, planting at a depth of up to 2.5” (6 cm) will help ensure an even crop yield by allowing roots to grow deeper down and access the moisture below Coulter, J. (2021). Strategies for successful corn planting. University of Minnesota Extension.. Spread phosphorus-rich fertilizer at planting or no later than two weeks following planting to provide crops the nutrition they need to grow. ## How To Care For Corn Plants Since there are so many aspects that must be continuously examined and managed for corn to grow healthily, there isn’t any definitive guide for how to care for it. Yet while maintaining growing crops, there are a few key areas that require your extra attention. First and foremost, during the corn growing season, you need to ensure sufficient irrigation and nutrient supply. A maximum of plants should be pollinated, so make sure of that as well. Last but not least, you need to protect your growing crops against weeds, pests, and diseases. ### Irrigation Providing enough water from the time of planting until harvesting is essential. Yield potential can be drastically lowered if the **corn plant’s water requirements** are not met during the reproductive growth phase. **How often to water corn plant?** It might be necessary to water growing crops each week to ensure they receive around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of moisture weekly. Don’t overwater either, as this could result in rotten seeds or plant roots. Knowing how plant water needs change throughout the growing season will help you make better-informed decisions about when and how much water to use for irrigation. EOSDA Crop Monitoring makes it simple to track how much water your crops require. The NDMI index shows the current moisture content of corn; any unusual readings indicate potential issues with soil moisture or a failure of plant water absorption. But the **NDMI index map aids in spotting these outliers early on** , giving you enough time to figure out what’s wrong and how to fix it. NDMI vegetation index map in EOSDA Crop Monitoring. Due to its shallow root system, corn is particularly susceptible to drought; therefore, it is essential to track moisture levels, especially surface soil moisture, over the whole growing season. Adjust irrigation using the soil moisture chart in EOSDA Crop Monitoring to prevent water stress on the growing corn plant. Graph displaying the surface soil moisture in EOSDA Crop Monitoring. ### Weed Control If you want your growing corn to thrive, you’ll need to keep the first month of its development devoid of competition from weeds. Make sure to destroy all the weeds growing around the stalks. Beyond that moment, the plant’s shallow roots may extend as far as 1 foot (30 cm) away from the stalk, so farm workers should take care not to damage them when physically removing weeds from the ground. Rather, they should spread mulch over the area to choke out any weeds that might try to grow. Similar to growing sugar cane, weeds pose the greatest threat to young corn plants. In order to **ensure a steady and healthy development of the growing corn** throughout this time, the MSAVI index in the EOSDA Crop Monitoring can help track any deviations in the plant’s life cycle. MSAVI map for the early corn growth stage. ### Fertilizing Growing corn successfully calls for the full complement of nutrients. Significant levels of nitrogen and potassium are required during the whole growing season, while nutrients like magnesium, iron, and sulfur are only needed in trace amounts. At the same time, the key to growing a healthy corn plant is making sure the soil has just enough minerals at every stage of plant growth. For this reason, timely and adequate fertilizer application is crucial. With the VRA maps on EOSDA Crop Monitoring, you can **smartly distinguish between areas and apply fertilizer in a targeted manner**. Save money and reduce waste by applying fertilizer only where and how much is actually needed. Variable rate technology used to generate these maps on the platform allows for the differential application of fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) throughout the growing season, as well as fertilization of the field with trace elements at the start or end of the season.

As the wind blows and the stalks brush against one another, the pollen is dispersed. Pollen is transferred from the corn tassels to the silks of the developing ears when the tassels first appear. **How much corn can you grow per acre?** Grow anything between 22 and 35 thousand plants on a single acre of the field to ensure adequate space for each plant along with proper pollination. Poorly pollinated plants will have ears with empty spots where the kernels should be. In such a situation, manual pollination comes in handy. Even in large fields, it has been shown that **hand-pollinatingincreases crop yield** by reducing the number of sterile stalks and improving kernel formation overall. Plan to grow only one corn variety to prevent cross-pollination between other cultivars, which can alter the flavor. Otherwise, separate your crop varieties by at least 300 feet (92 m). ### Pest And Disease Control Corn diseases tend to be weather-dependent. For instance, Northern Corn Leaf Blight (NCLB) proliferates in the growing corn if the weather is too chilly and moist. Root rot and common smut may spread in hot, dry growing conditions. Economic losses from these crop diseases can be mitigated through **preventative methods** , including appropriate irrigation, growing resistant hybrids, and the composting of plant residue. Fungicides and other methods of disease control throughout the growing season are also beneficial. In addition to the widespread diseases, there are various corn-specific pests to deal with. The corn earworm ( _Heliothis virescens_ ) and the corn leaf worm ( _Spodoptera frugiperda_ ) are the two most common ones. Systematic spraying of growing crops with the right amount of pesticide is the best way to control them. Crop rotation and cover crops also prove to be useful long- term strategies in the fight against pests and diseases. While traditional methods of corn pest and disease control remain important, forward-thinking farmers attempt to stay one step ahead using technology. In a season-long battle with corn diseases, the right tools for crop health monitoring, can make all the difference. By combining precise weather forecasts for up to 14 days with data on crop growth stages, our Disease risk feature provides a comprehensive view of potential outbreaks across your fields. This means you can easily identify the most vulnerable areas, prioritize scouting inspections, and tailor disease management strategies accordingly. The Disease risk interface with color-coded risk levels. All of these maintenance practices promoting the corn growth process will ensure a robust crop and a reasonable financial return even in less-than-ideal weather conditions without requiring the farmer to put in excessive labor or time. ## How Long Does It Take For Corn To Grow? It usually takes between two and three months from planting seeds to harvesting mature crops. Corn growth time varies widely among different cultivars. Some types of corn (for example, _Seneca Horizon_ or _Earlivee_ ) need just 58–65 days to grow, whereas others (such as _Silver Queen_ , _Platinum Lady_ , and _Camelot_ ) require 86–92 days to reach maturity. The average corn growing time for each variety is typically specified on the back of the seed packet. It is crucial to choose a variety that can **thrive in your region’s average growing season**. ## How To Harvest Corn Corn harvesting is often done in October and November. Crops should be harvested when the grain is relatively dry, with a **moisture percentage of 23%–25%.** At this level of water content, kernels are fairly simple to remove from the cob. After the corn growing season is complete, don’t be reluctant to harvest. By harvesting early, you can prevent field losses due to corn ear drops or fungi and save your crops from being damaged by frost and storms, while delays in harvesting exacerbate issues caused by fungal infections inside the kernels. These holdups enable pathogenic fungi to develop more mycotoxins, making the grain unsafe for people and animals to eat. In lodged crops, rotting of the stalks grows quickly, so it’s important to harvest those fields first. Harvesting crops from vast acres takes a grain combine. The combine uses special mechanisms to remove the hulls and separate the kernels from the cobs. During harvesting, only the kernels are saved; the husks and cobs are discarded. Corn cobs and stalks remaining on the field help minimize erosion and restore plant matter, both of which are beneficial to the soil for future corn growing. If you invest consistent effort during the corn growing season, you’ll be rewarded with bumper crops. Increases in crop productivity are inevitable when high-yielding growing conditions like warmth, nutrients, watering, and smart farming practices are put into place.

Be sure to start with young corn plants from Bonnie Plants®. Strong and vigorous, they will give you a great start on a big harvest. Corn needs plenty of space for two reasons — it takes up a lot of nutrition from the soil, and it is primarily pollinated by wind. As grains of pollen are shed by the tassels that grow from the plants' tops, they must find their way to the delicate strands of silk that emerge from newly formed ears. To make sure silks are nicely showered with pollen, grow corn in blocks of short rows rather than in a long, single row. In a small garden, 15 plants set 1 foot apart can be grown in a 3 x 5-foot bed. Growing corn on this tiny scale is a good way to introduce yourself to the crop if you've never grown it. After the first year you will probably want to increase the size of the planting to at least 4 rows 10 feet long. Corn plants are not like tomatoes or most other vegetables, which bear over a long period of time. Instead, they form a few ears per stalk and they are finished. Because of this, gardeners who have the space often make 2 or 3 plantings 2 weeks apart to keep the harvest coming. ## Quick Guide to Growing Corn * Hold off on planting corn in spring until after the last frost. * Space seedlings 8 to 12 inches apart in an area with full sun and fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8. * Improve native soil conditions by mixing in several inches of aged compost or other rich organic matter. * Corn will grow quickly when it is watered well. Check soil moisture often and consider using a soaker hose if you have a small plot. * Corn has a big appetite, so it's important to feed plants with a water-soluble plant food regularly. * Add a 3-inch layer of mulch to keep soil moist and prevent weeds. * Harvest corn when the ear feels plump and the silks are brown and dry. ## Soil, Planting, and Care Corn needs a spot with that gets full sun and has fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8. It's a good idea to improve the soil to improve nutrition and texture by mixing aged compost-enriched Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® All Purpose In-Ground Soil in with the top few inches of native soil. Seedlings can be set out as soon as the last spring frost has passed. Space plants 8 to 12 inches apart. In case of a surprise late frost, be prepared to cover seedlings with a fabric row cover. In cold climates you can plant in a raised bed covered with black or IRT plastic (infrared transmitting plastic) that will warm the soil. If possible, lay the plastic a week or so before planting. Plan to fertilize regularly because corn is a hungry plant. In addition to setting out young plants in the kind of nutrient-rich soil mentioned above, you'll want to feed corn regularly with a continuous-release fertilizer like Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® Edibles Plant Nutrition Granules that nourishes both the soil and your plants. (Be sure to follow rates given on the label of any fertilizer you are using.) Water your corn once or twice weekly, more if the weather is hot and dry. Normal plants should grow fast with dark green healthy leaves. Corn will tell you if it is hungry by turning very light green. If so, feed again. Corn grows fast and needs lots of water to grow properly. It also has shallow roots that make it susceptible to drought. Soaker hoses will insure that your corn gets the water it needs. However, for a large planting, soaker hoses may not be practical. #### Hopi and Navaho Techniques Native Americans in arid climates planted corn in basins to catch spring rainwater and help keep the corn roots down where water would be available longer. The basin was about 4 inches deep and 2 to 3 feet wide with a raised ridge made from the excavated soil around it. Plants were arranged so that they formed a spiral from the center to help with support in wind and with pollination. If you live in an arid climate or a hot climate and have poor sandy soil, as in the Coastal Plains, this technique could help ensure a good harvest. ## Troubleshooting Corn plants that are blown over by gusty storms usually right themselves after a few days of sunny weather. As you shuck and clean your corn, pop off ear tips damaged by corn earworms. The different types of corn should not be allowed to cross-pollinate, so plant them in such a way that pollen from one type does not reach another type. If you or a nearby neighbor grow multiple types, be sure that they are isolated by at least 250 feet or that their timing is such that they are not in bloom at the same time. If not, the pollen from types that are not the same can muddy their characteristics to the point of ruining sweetness and flavor. Raccoons love corn. The most effective way to keep them out of the patch is to surround it with a fence with 2 strands of electric wire 4 and 12 inches from the ground. Some gardeners have been successful with throwing blackbird netting over and around the plants because some raccoons don't like it. The methods for keeping raccoons out of corn are as varied as gardeners themselves. We've heard of people putting flashing lights in the corn patch, putting a radio on a timer to blare loud music, laying newspaper in rows because the raccoons don't like to walk on the crinkly paper, spraying animal repellents, and other techniques, but a physical barrier such as an electrified fence seems to be the most reliable. ## Harvest and Storage Most corn plants will yield at least 2 ears per stalk. Hybrids may yield more. To see if an ear is ready for harvest, look at the silks. They should be brown and dry with just a little fresh green at the base. Squeeze the husk to see if the ear inside feels plump, not skinny. If you're still not sure if the ear seems ripe, check by peeling just enough of the husk back to expose a couple of inches of the ear. Poke a kernel with your fingernail. The corn is ready to pick if it bleeds a light milky sap like skim milk. If the liquid is clear, the ear is not ready. Ears that are too ripe will look too milky, like cream versus skim milk; they often taste starchy. Remove them right away. Perfectly ripened ears also taste sugary-sweet when sampled raw. When possible, harvest sweet corn in the morning, when the ears are cool. To remove the ear, use one hand to hold the corn stalk and the other to pull the ear down and away from the stalk, twisting a little until it breaks off. Place harvested ears in the refrigerator right away. When kept chilled, they should hold much of their sweet flavor for up to a week, though they'll taste best if eaten as close to harvesting as possible. Corn can be blanched and frozen, on or off the cob. ![Image: In areas where the soil stays cool longer, cover the ground with black plastic or IRT film a week or two before planting and set transplants through holes cut into the material](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0603/4892/4151/files/corn-plants- groundcover-lo.jpg) In areas where the soil stays cool longer, cover the ground with black plastic or IRT film a week or two before planting and set transplants through holes cut into the material. ![Image: Corn plants need plenty of space because they are large, but they can be planted with other vegetables in a large garden.

Typically, rust won't damage corn yields, unless growing conditions are exceedingly stressful (drought, flood, etc.). ### When is the best time of day to harvest corn? Sweet corn is ready to pick when a test kernel pierced with your fingernail bleeds a light milky sap, like skim milk. Ripe ears will taste sugary-sweet when sampled raw. After picking, the sugar in corn turns to starch, reducing sweetness. Knowing this, some people harvest corn right before cooking, thinking they're preserving the sweetness. Corn actually has the highest sugar content early in the morning, before the sun touches them. If you want the sweetest flavor, pick ears early in the morning and refrigerate in the husk until cooking. ### How do I know if ears are ripe? Try to avoid peeling the husk to peek at ears. It's best to keep husks in place until cooking. Ripe ears feel full and rounded and have silk that's dried and brown on the ends. If you do peek at end kernels, pierce a kernel and look for milky sapÑthat's another sign of ripeness. ### I was weeding around the corn with a hoe yesterday. Today stalks are wilted, even though the soil is moist. What is happening? Corn is a shallow rooted plant. You might have broken corn roots if you hoed weeds deeply, chopping into soil near stalks. Keep weeds in check by cultivating frequently so you don't have to do much more than scuffle the soil to dislodge offenders. ### The corn in my garden is attracting birds and raccoons. What can I do to protect the harvest? A scarecrow can keep birds at bay if you dress it in loose fitting clothes that will move in the wind and decorate it with strips of aluminum foil to flutter and reflect light. Ideally, move your scarecrow every few days so birds don't become accustomed to it. Raccoons require more aggressive tactics. Try a two-strand electric fence (one strand 4 inches off the ground, the second strand 12 inches high). Turn on the power about a week before you think the first ears will be ripe. ### Shoots are coming out of my corn stalks near the ground. Will they produce corn? These shoots are called suckers and won't form ears. While it's not necessary to remove them, many experienced home gardeners believe removing suckers produces larger, better quality ears. This hasn't been proven. If you do choose to remove suckers, snap them off while they're less than 3 inches tall to avoid damaging the stalk. ### My garden space is small. Can I grow corn without planting it in long rows? Corn is wind pollinated, and research has proven that it's actually better to arrange plants in blocks of short rows rather than long rows. That means even small gardens can squeeze in a corn crop. Arrange corn in at least four rows side-by-side, spacing rows 12-24 inches apart. Wind will blow the pollen from one corn stalk to another.

The key ingredient in classic Italian pesto, Sweet Basil has big leaves that are fast and easy to grow so that you can make your own pesto to freeze for year-round use. It loves hot weather, so always wait until all danger of frost is past before planting in the garden in the spring, then harvest before the weather starts to cool down in fall. Great for containers, but be sure to keep watered. If you were to grow only one herb, this should probably be it. Dried basil just doesn’t have the aromatic quality of the fresh leaves, which are often added at the last minute to many Asian dishes.

Jalapeño produces 3-inch, thick-walled, moderately hot pods with deep green color that matures to a bright red. The skin may show a netting pattern as fruit ages, but it does not affect flavor. Often, the heat of the peppers will vary, even those from the same plant. If peppers grow fast, get plenty of water, and are harvested soon, they may be milder than peppers that stay on the plant a long time, or that develop slowly and under stressful conditions. Widely adapted, jalapeño plants yield a bountiful harvest in dry or humid, hot or cool climates. The compact plants grow well in containers. Use jalapeño on nachos or in salsa, or smoke the mature red ones over mesquite chips to make your own chipotle sauce. Jalapeño became the first pepper in space when a bag full of pods accompanied astronauts on the shuttle Columbia in November 1982!

The leaves have an instantly recognizable fragrance that fills a room when you cut them. Sometimes called Chinese parsley, its distinctive aroma and flavor is also part of Caribbean and Asian foods, lending flavor to recaito, salsas, curries, salads, chutneys, herbed butters, and meat marinades.Cilantro looks like flat leaf Italian parsley, but the leaves are thinner. It grows in a rosette of stemmy leaves that are ready to harvest shortly after planting. Young leaves have the best flavor, so be sure to harvest often. It is a fast-growing annual except in milder climates where it will overwinter. Cilantro grows tall and blooms at the end of its life, usually after the weather gets hot. After it blooms, harvest the seeds--they are what you buy in spice jars as coriander, another common ingredient in Asian cooking. You can grind the seeds or use them whole. Some gardeners also let the seeds drop to make new plants.Fall is a great time to grow cilantro in mild climates, as the plants are frost tolerant and love the cool weather in fall, winter, and early spring.Organic varieties are only available at retailers. **2-pack** starter plants **19.3 fl oz** pot volume **Full Sun to Partial Shade** Product variants Default Title \- $17.99 Decrease quantity for Increase quantity for Regular price $17.99 Regular price ~~~~ Sale price $17.99 Unit price / per Add to cart ![Image: Sweet Green Bell Pepper (2 Pack)](https://bonnieplants.com/blogs/how- to- grow/bonnieplants.com/cdn/shop/products/060721_T110854_202047_202181_Bonnie_PepperGreenBell_ALT_01.jpg?v=1653423009&width=400) Sweet Green Bell Pepper (2 Pack) Bonnie's best hybrid sweet bell pepper!

At first the foliage might be easily confused with cilantro. However, its flavor is distinctly parsley, and it is favored for its deep flavor, which some say holds up better in cooking than curly parsley. It is popular in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. Easy to chop, the nutritious flat leaves are high in iron and in vitamins A, C, and E. A high chlorophyll content makes it a natural breath sweetener, too. This is a great plant for containers, especially for fall and winter in zone 7 and south. Of course, you can also use it in vegetable and herb beds. In a flower bed it makes a nice, green leafy companion to small flowers such as pansies. It is also more tolerant of hot weather than curly parsley (which can struggle during the peak of summer) and is frost tolerant.

A 1992 All-America Selections winner, this variety of dill continues to be a favorite for its garden performance and the fact that it offers a lot of foliage. It is also slower to set seed than ordinary dill varieties, which means that you can harvest foliage longer.

Highly aromatic, it enhances meat dishes, eggs, cheeses, soups, and sauces, and it is a primary component of both Bouquet Garni and Herbes de Provence. Use it to elevate the flavor of good ole' beef stew, too. This tiny-leaved thyme is among the most aromatic, more so than larger-leafed varieties. You may also hear it called winter thyme, because it is one of the most cold hardy of all the different thymes. The leaves are evergreen to semi-evergreen, depending on the how far North it is growing. In the warm, humid climates of zones 9 and 10 it may suffer in the summer; in zone 10 it is best to lower your expectations and just consider it a cool season annual. Thyme is well suited for containers because of its size and the fact that it demands perfect drainage. Give it excellent drainage in a pot and good air circulation. Because it is low-growing and has thin stems and a wiry habit, don't crowd it because vigorous neighboring plants might choke it out. Upright-growing rosemary is a good companion. **2-pack** starter plants **19.3 fl oz** pot volume **Full Sun to Partial Shade** Product variants Default Title \- $17.99 Decrease quantity for Increase quantity for Regular price $17.99 Regular price ~~~~ Sale price $17.99 Unit price / per Add to cart ![Image: Italian Oregano (2 Pack)](https://bonnieplants.com/blogs/how-to- grow/bonnieplants.com/cdn/shop/products/052322_T118630_202017_Bonnie_Italian_Oregano_ALT_01.jpg?v=1655307990&width=400) Italian Oregano (2 Pack) Savor classic Italian cuisine with the flavorful leaves of this oregano.

Square stems tend to run rampantly over — and under — soil. In small garden spaces, it's best to tuck peppermint into a pot to curtail its wandering ways. Peppermint thrives alongside water gardens or in damp spots in the yard, but will also survive in drier soil. Lushest growth occurs in moist soil in partial shade.

3 MIN READ # Considerations on Cold and Corn Planting April 23, 2023 * Deciding to plant when soil temperatures and forecasted temperatures are below 50° degrees F. This must be made on a case-by-case basis and opinions may vary widely. * Continuing to plant through cooler temperatures can keep planting operations moving; however, when planting into cold soil, corn kernels will be slow to germinate, plants will be slow to emerge, and the risk of seedling death is elevated. * * * #### **Asking the What Ifs:** There will always be risk involved, no matter when a grower decides to plant. The few Ifs will always come to mind. ** ** * Is it risky to plant into cold soil conditions? Yes. * Is it risky to plant corn late in the season? Yes. * Will the crop achieve a better stand if there is no stress? Yes. But many factors affect the amount and timing of environmental stress. Determining the greatest risks are judgement calls that vary from one grower to the next. #### **Factors to Consider: ** * The calendar date in relation to your own planting progress. * Soils are wetter than ideal. * Heavy rainfall in the near-term forecast. * Comfort level with rate of germination (slower or faster depending on soil temperatures). * Late planted corn vs. cold planted corn. * Ample soil moisture in the next coming weeks. * Check with local seed dealers about cold tolerance of corn hybrids.1 * Cold tests determine the seed availability.2 These above-mentioned factors could impact each operation differently. However, certain facts relating to corn planting and management must be taken into consideration when deciding to plant into less-than-ideal conditions. #### **Corn Germination and Quality:** * Corn requires a 50° F of soil temperature to germinate. * Planting into soil with less than 50° F of soil temperature will cause the seed to sit dormant, and lead to increasing seed vulnerability to diseases, insects, and animal predators. * In cool conditions, corn may not emerge for 3 to 4 weeks.3 It takes about 90-to-120-degree days for corn to emerge at a base of 50° F. * High quality seed treated with seed treatments can better handle stress, and eventually increase the emergence probability. * Delayed planting can allow warmer soil temperatures for faster germination and emergence of corn. * Cold and water-saturated soil can cause seed to be affected by imbibitional chilling. Imbibitional chilling injury can occur when dry corn seeds swell after absorbing (imbibing) cold water from rain or melting snow within 24 to 36 hours after planting.2,5 The cold water causes the cell membranes to become rigid and rupture, and germination does not occur. The non-germinated, swollen seed dies and results in lowered plant population. * Cold soils or large variations in soil temperatures during the germination process can cause the mesocotyl to become deformed or have a corkscrewed appearance(Figure 1).2 This can occur when healthy mesocotyl tissue continues to grow while damaged tissue does not. * The likelihood of obtaining good emergence when planting into cool soils increases when little or no rainfall occurs between planting and emergence.4 * * * ![Image: Seedling development impacted by cold imbibition image](https://cs- assets.bayer.com/is/image/bayer/KT-2019042306) Figure 1. Seedling development impacted by cold imbibition. * * * #### **Management Options: ** * Early planting allows the opportunity to replant if emergence is poor or stand is inadequate. #### ** Takeaway Points: ** We cannot predict the future to assure a perfect crop stand, but we can analyze conditions and assess risks to help in determining the best corn planting options. * * * ##### **Sources** ##### 1Knox, S. 2018.
