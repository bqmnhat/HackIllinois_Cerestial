Water is the most common limiting factor for many crops in Ohio. Too much water can also be a problem, leading to standing water, erosion, and nutrient loss. A soil with a low water holding capacity will have a narrow window between too much and not enough moisture. Both conditions lead to poor plant growth. ### Organic Matter Increased soil organic matter enhances your soil's ability to absorb water, leading to less water stress during both dry and wet periods. This can be achieved by: * Incorporate compost, manures, or other stable organic materials. * Grow and incorporate a high biomass cover crop. * Add a perennial crop to your rotation. * Add a sod crop to your rotation. * Reduce tillage to provide less disturbance to soil biota and structure. ### **Mulch** Mulches are useful for retaining soil moisture under dry conditions. Common sources of mulches include hay, straw, cut forage, wood chips or shredded bark, or plastic. Mulches can provide additional benefits such as weed control or organic matter, but may also come with potential drawbacks. Several cover crop varieties can be interseeded and used as living mulches, but can also provide competition for limited water and nutrients. Mulches can also be expensive and/or time consuming to purchase, apply, and dispose of. Mulches with a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio may tie up soil nitrogen supplies. If not carefully sourced, mulches may also introduce weed seeds and disease. Keep in mind that a mulch's ability to retain moisture and cool temperatures may not be welcomed year-round. Cooler soil temperature can slow germination or plant growth and soils prone to flooding or pooling will experience standing water more readily when mulched. ## Search form Search ## Have a soil health question? ## ![Image: A call out with a question mark.](https://soilhealth.osu.edu/sites/soilhealth/files/imce/Images/question_callout.png) Soil health experts at The Ohio State University will address your question(s). ## Locate An Office We connect with people in all stages of life, from young children to older adults.

Healthy soil smells sweet and earthy. It feels soft, moist, and friable, and allows plant roots to grow unimpeded.

Soil Health Assessment Soil health is an assessment of how well soil performs all of its functions now and how those functions are being preserved for future use. Soil health cannot be determined by measuring only crop yield, water quality, or any other single outcome. Soil health cannot be measured directly, so we evaluate indicators. Indicators are measurable properties of soil or plants that provide clues about how well the soil can function. Indicators can be physical, chemical, and biological properties, processes, or characteristics of soils. They can also be morphological or visual features of plants. **Useful indicators:** * are easy to measure, * measure changes in soil functions, * encompass chemical, biological, and physical properties, * are accessible to many users and applicable to field conditions, and * are sensitive to variations in climate and management. Indicators can be assessed by qualitative or quantitative techniques. After measurements are collected, they can be evaluated by looking for patterns and comparing results to measurements taken at a different time or field. ### Indicator Examples and Relationship to Soil Health * Soil organic matter => nutrient retention; soil fertility; soil structure; soil stability; and soil erosion * Physical: bulk density, infiltration, soil structure and macropores, soil depth, and water holding capacity => retention and transport of water and nutrients; habitat for soil microbes; estimate of crop productivity potential; compaction, plow pan, water movement; porosity; and tilth * Chemical: electrical conductivity, reactive carbon, soil nitrate, soil pH, and extractable phosphorus and potassium => biological and chemical activity thresholds; plant and microbial activity thresholds; and plant available nutrients and potential for N and P loss * Biological: earthworms, microbial biomass C and N, particulate organic matter, potentially mineralizable N, soil enzymes, soil respiration, and total organic carbon => microbial catalytic potential and repository for C and N; soil productivity and N supplying potential; and microbial activity measure ## Documents Cropland In Field Soil Health Assessment Guide (3.34 MB) Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (9.64 MB) * * * ## Soil Quality Indicator Sheets A series of information sheets for physical, chemical and biological indicators to help conservationists and soil scientists with soil health assessment.
