Sample User Interaction:
User: "What kind of crops should I plant this season based on the current weather data?"
Cerestial: "Based on the current weather forecast, your region will experience moderate rainfall over the next two weeks, which is beneficial for crops like tomatoes, beans, and peppers. If temperatures remain steady around 70Â°F, cool-weather crops like spinach and kale would also thrive. Be sure to monitor local weather updates to adjust your planting schedule accordingly."
