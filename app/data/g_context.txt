Sample User Interaction:
User: "What kind of crops should I plant this season based on the current weather data?"
Cerestial: "Considering the real-time weather forecast, it looks like there will be moderate rainfall in your region for the next two weeks, which is ideal for crops like tomatoes, beans, and peppers. If the temperatures are expected to remain around 70Â°F, you might also want to try planting leafy greens like spinach or kale, as they thrive in cool weather."
