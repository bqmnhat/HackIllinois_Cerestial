USDA has programs and practices that help farmers improve water quality while gaining efficiencies and reducing costs. Category \- Any - ## On This Page Improving Water Quality on Your Land Focus on Water Quality Water Quality Practices for Working Lands ## Improving Water Quality on Your Land ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/erosion- icon.svg) ### Fight Erosion When soil stays in the field, it not only provides better soil for crop production, but also reduces sediment entering the water table. Erosion fighting practices include: * Cover crops * No till or reduced till * Crop rotation ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/management- icon.svg) ### Enhance Management Management of use of fertilizers and pesticides to keep them on the field or pasture can reduce costs as well as potential for loss. Water friendly management practices include: * Integrated pest management * Nutrient management * Irrigation water management ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/filtration- icon.svg) ### Improve Filtration In field practice can help reduce runoff, but filtering the runoff to remove sediment, chemicals, and waste can improve downstream water quality. Practices that help filter runoff include: * Filter strip * Riparian forest buffer * Bioreactor ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/waste- icon.svg) ### Manage Animal Waste Preventing animal waste from entering water sources is a key way to protect water quality. Practices that manage animal waste include: * Prescribed grazing * Waste storage * Waste management ## Focus on Water Quality ### Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agricultural lands make up nearly 30% of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which includes the District of Columbia and portions of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. This region has more than 83,000 farms responsible for more than $10 billion in agricultural production each year. Between 2018 and 2020, NRCS helped farmers implement conservation on 1.26 million acres in the Bay watershed. That’s the size of Grand Canyon National Park. USDA will invest an additional $22.5 million in conservation assistance in fiscal year 2022 building on a $1.1 billion investment over the past decade. Read more about NRCS’s work in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. * * * ### National Water Quality Initiative The National Water Quality Initiative (NWQI) is USDA’s premiere water quality initiative. It accelerates on-farm conservation investments focused on improving water quality where it is most needed. Since 2012, NRCS has worked with more than 6,000 producers to adopt conservation practices on more than 1.37 million acres in priority watersheds through NWQI. At least 19 impaired water bodies have been improved and subsequently scheduled for de-listing or otherwise removed from NWQI due to successful water quality improvements. Learn more about watersheds that are part of NWQI’s current efforts. * * * ### Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative Launched in 2009, the 12-state Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI) helps landowners sustain America’s natural resources through voluntary conservation. States within the Mississippi River Basin have developed nutrient reduction strategies to minimize the contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters within the basin, and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico. MRBI uses a small watershed approach to support the states’ reduction strategies. Avoiding, controlling and trapping practices are implemented to reduce the amount of nutrients flowing from agricultural land into waterways and to improve the resiliency of working lands. These targeted investments have increased the adoption of critical water quality conservation practices, such as cover crops, no-till, residue management, grassed waterways and nutrient management by over 30%. Learn more about MRBI. * * * ### Great Lake Restoration Initiative The Great Lake Restoration Initiative (GLRI) helps NRCS accelerate conservation efforts on private lands located in targeted watersheds throughout the Great Lakes region. Through GLRI, NRCS works with farmers and landowners to combat invasive species, protect watersheds and shorelines from non-point source pollution and restore wetlands and other habitat areas. Practices implemented by farmers working in partnership with NRCS through GLRI have reduced phosphorus by over 1.1 million pounds in target areas since 2010. Learn more about GLRI. * * * ### Additional Approaches In addition to these initiatives, NRCS offers edge-of-field monitoring, which allows producers to measure the effects of conservation work on water quality. This helps farmers make informed decisions about efficiency, economic impacts, and yields. NRCS also supports market-based approaches to improve water quality. ## Water Quality Practices for Working Lands ### Cover Crops The roots of cover crops make channels in the soil that improves its ability to take in water. Cover crops also build soil organic matter, hold soil in place that might otherwise erode, and feed soil organisms that provide valuable nutrients to cash crops during the traditional growing season. ![Image: video duration time](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/time-duration- icon-20.svg) **2 minute video** Remote video URL ### Grassed Waterway Grassed Waterway is a way of repurposing marginal lands to improve filtration of runoff and reduce erosion from farm land. It has the added benefit of creating riparian habitat. ![Image: video duration time](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/time-duration- icon-20.svg) **2 minute video** Remote video URL ### No Till We’ve learned that most operations do not need heavy tillage – or often any tillage at all – to produce healthy crops. Minimizing tillage can reduce soil erosion across your operation while saving time and money. Read the USDA blog story: Saving Money, Time and Soil: The Economics of No-Till Farming. ![Image: video duration time](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/time-duration- icon-20.svg) **2 minute video** Remote video URL ## Farmers.gov Blog Previous Conservation ### Ask the Expert: A Q&A on Agricultural Wetlands and Water Quality with Dr. Joseph Prenger Elizabeth Creech, Natural Resources Inventory and Assessment • Feb 01, 2023 Conservation ### Ask the Expert: A Q&A on Water Quality Outcomes of Voluntary Conservation with Lisa Duriancik Elizabeth Creech, Natural Resources Inventory and Assessment • Aug 24, 2022 Conservation ### Ask the Expert: A Q&A on Voluntary Edge-of-Field Water Quality Monitoring with Karma Anderson Amy Overstreet, Natural Resources Inventory and Assessment • Aug 11, 2022 Conservation ### Restoring Clean Water Tracy Robillard, USDA • Apr 03, 2020 Conservation ### Water Conservation and Innovation Through a “Pro” Partnership Chris Groskreutz, USDA • Apr 23, 2019 Disaster Planning and Assistance ### Drought-Driven Creative Thinking Leads to Innovative Water System for Cattle Donnie Lunsford, NRCS • Aug 06, 2018 Next ## Find Your Local Service Center View in: Ver en: * Español USDA Service Centers are locations where you can connect with Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or Rural Development employees for your business needs.

Home 2. Conservation Basics 3. Natural Resource Concerns 4. Soil Health 5. Soil Health Assessment Soil health is an assessment of how well soil performs all of its functions now and how those functions are being preserved for future use. Soil health cannot be determined by measuring only crop yield, water quality, or any other single outcome. Soil health cannot be measured directly, so we evaluate indicators. Indicators are measurable properties of soil or plants that provide clues about how well the soil can function. Indicators can be physical, chemical, and biological properties, processes, or characteristics of soils. They can also be morphological or visual features of plants. **Useful indicators:** * are easy to measure, * measure changes in soil functions, * encompass chemical, biological, and physical properties, * are accessible to many users and applicable to field conditions, and * are sensitive to variations in climate and management. Indicators can be assessed by qualitative or quantitative techniques. After measurements are collected, they can be evaluated by looking for patterns and comparing results to measurements taken at a different time or field. ### Indicator Examples and Relationship to Soil Health * Soil organic matter => nutrient retention; soil fertility; soil structure; soil stability; and soil erosion * Physical: bulk density, infiltration, soil structure and macropores, soil depth, and water holding capacity => retention and transport of water and nutrients; habitat for soil microbes; estimate of crop productivity potential; compaction, plow pan, water movement; porosity; and tilth * Chemical: electrical conductivity, reactive carbon, soil nitrate, soil pH, and extractable phosphorus and potassium => biological and chemical activity thresholds; plant and microbial activity thresholds; and plant available nutrients and potential for N and P loss * Biological: earthworms, microbial biomass C and N, particulate organic matter, potentially mineralizable N, soil enzymes, soil respiration, and total organic carbon => microbial catalytic potential and repository for C and N; soil productivity and N supplying potential; and microbial activity measure ## Documents Cropland In Field Soil Health Assessment Guide (3.34 MB) Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (9.64 MB) * * * ## Soil Quality Indicator Sheets A series of information sheets for physical, chemical and biological indicators to help conservationists and soil scientists with soil health assessment.
