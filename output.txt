Entities are uniquely positioned to do this work and encouraging on-farm conservation, including soil health practices, can help them achieve additional environmental outcomes. Soil health programming also offers a way to engage additional agricultural landowners in the community. To undertake this work, entities can tap into existing federal and state conservation programs.

Overcome Barriers to Adoption Go to top Collapse ## Soil Health Basics ### Learn about Soil Health Soil is a living ecosystem made up of minerals, organic matter, and pore spaces containing air, water and dissolved nutrients, and living organisms. Healthy soils support agricultural production; filter and store water; “cycle” or move nutrients between the physical environment to living organisms; moderate temperature extremes; protect plants from pathogens and stress; store carbon and moderate the release of gases; resist erosion; and provide habitat for soil organisms. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) defines soil health as the soil’s continued capacity to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals and humans. One indicator of healthy soils is **aggregate stability**. Aggregates are clusters of soil particles bound together. Aggregate stability refers to the ability of soil aggregates to maintain their structure when exposed to water, wind, or tillage. Stable aggregates provide habitat for soil biota, which increases soil organic matter, improves soil structure, and increases water holding capacity. Use the slake test and soil function videos listed below to demonstrate soil aggregate stability. Stable aggregates will not break apart or slake in water. You also can use the simulator instructor guide to run your own demonstration, which might be a good way to engage agricultural landowners in your community. Most of our soils have lost significant function over time because of repeated disturbance. As you interact with your landowners, look for these signs of degraded soils: * Gullies and other signs of erosion * Hard, compacted, cloddy soils * Rapid onset of stress or stunted growth during dry or wet periods * Discolored vegetation * Soil crusting * Disease or pest pressure * Declining yields Identifying degraded soils provides an opportunity to begin a conversation with agricultural landowners and help raise awareness about soil health. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read NRCS Soil Health Fact Sheets, Soil Health: Basics and Benefits NRCS Soil Health Fact Sheets, Unlock Your Farm's Potential: Dig a Little, Learn a Lot #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Soil Function Demonstration Video Slake Test Video #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Full-scale Rainfall Simulator Instructor Guide ### Understand Soil Health Principles and Practices The way farmers and ranchers manage their land affects soil health. Farmers and ranchers can rebuild their soils and restore key functions using regenerative soil health practices. **Principles ****![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Four-soil-health-principles-300x128.png)** Conservation professionals, including NRCS, promote four principles to restore and protect soil health: 1. Minimize disturbance: reduce tilling and the use of chemical inputs, rotate grazing animals; 2. Maximize soil cover: keep the soil surface covered with residue year round; 3. Maximize biodiversity: integrate livestock and grow as many different species of plants as possible through rotations and a diverse mixture of cover crops; 4. Maximize continuous living roots: keep living crops and cover crops in the soil as long as possible. **Practices **Each principle is achieved through a range of associated conservation practices—specific land management strategies producers can implement to protect and restore natural resources. The first two principles protect the habitat for soil organisms. Practices that minimize disturbance include reduced tillage, nutrient management, integrated pest management, and prescribed grazing. Land management strategies to maximize soil cover include cover cropping, residue and tillage management, and prescribed grazing. Together, these approaches increase soil organic matter, stabilize soil aggregates, and improve water infiltration and storage, which reduces the risk of erosion, helps mitigate temperature changes, and reduces evaporation. The second two principles aim to feed soil organisms. Practices to increase biodiversity include integrating livestock into a production system and growing different species of plants through rotations or a diverse mixture of cover crops. Cover crops and crop rotation can also promote living roots in soils, as can incorporating dedicated grasslands. These principles increase biological activity and diversity belowground. They increase soil organic matter and nutrient cycling and improve plant growth. A soil health management system is a collection of practices that increase soil carbon levels and improve soil health by applying the four soil health principles. When implemented together, and adapted as needed to different production systems, these principles can rebuild soils and restore their functions. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read An Introduction to Soil Health Practices NRCS Soil Health Fact Sheets, Principles for High Functioning Soils NRCS Soil Health Fact Sheets, Unlock Your Farm's Potential: Do Not Disturb NRCS Soil Health Fact Sheets, Unlock Your Farm's Potential: Discover the Cover NRCS Soil Health Fact Sheets, Healthy Productive Soils: Checklist for Growers #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Soil Health Practices for Working Lands Webpage #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Farmers.gov Soil Health Webpage Soil Health Technical Note No. 450-04, The Basics of Addressing Resource Concerns with Conservation Practices with Integrated Soil Health Systems on Cropland Management ### Overcome Barriers to Adoption There are psychological, social, technical, and financial barriers to adopting soil health practices. New practices require a new way of thinking for many producers. Farmers, ranchers and other agricultural landowners may not understand why it is important to adopt soil health practices, which requires a basic understanding of soil function and soil health benefits. In addition, there may be a lack of community support for adoption of new or different practices. Another challenge, especially in places where most land is rented, is convincing producers to invest resources into improving soil health and/or convincing landowners to forgo some income to support practice adoption. A next hurdle is acquiring the technical knowledge to implement new practices and management systems. Lastly, stakeholders may worry about the financial impact of adoption. They may lack information to help them assess the costs, including installation and time learning versus benefits. You can help your landowners overcome these barriers by: * **Cultivating a relationship with your producer.** Look for opportunities to connect with them while stewarding the easement. Ask them about their goals for their land and find out if they have any concerns about their land. * **Raising their awareness**. Once you have established a relationship, you can offer information and help organize or host educational opportunities to introduce landowners to new principles and practices. * **Creating supportive networks**. You may be able to introduce landowners who are curious about practices to others who have already tested different strategies. You can help facilitate information sharing among producers and other agricultural landowners. * **Connecting them with technical experts**. You can also make referrals to technical experts who can help develop and implement a soil health management plan and connect them with applicable state and federal programs to provide technical and financial assistance. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT’s Soil Health Basics Training Session Webinar #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use USDA Service Center Locator NRCS State Office Websites Benefits Next Sections Jump to Section 1. Learn about the Case Studies 2. Quantify Soil Health Outcomes 3. Use the Case Study Findings Go to top Collapse ## Soil Health Benefits Research suggests that implementing practices such as no-till or reduced tillage, cover cropping, nutrient management, and conservation crop rotation can improve soil health, reduce runoff, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and sequester carbon. Information on the economic benefits associated with soil health is also important to those in the agricultural community, including growers, landowners, agricultural retailers, bankers, and corporations with sustainability goals, for whom knowing the “bottom line” is important to making decisions. ### Learn about the Soil Health Case Studies The AFT-NRCS Soil Health Case Studies estimate the economic effects of implementing soil health practices by looking at the costs, benefits, and return on investment experienced by farmers who have adopted any one or a combination of soil health practices. The findings of these case studies are intended to give farmers confidence in adopting practices that have the potential to lessen agriculture’s impacts on water resources, address climate change, and increase farmer resilience and viability. **Case study methods **The economic impacts of implementing soil health practices on case study farms were derived using Partial Budget Analysis (PBA). A PBA estimates the economic effect—both benefits and costs—of variables affected by a change in a farming operation. For the Soil Heal Case Studies, the PBA compares costs and benefits “before” and “after” soil health practice implementation. To conduct this PBA, AFT developed a **Retrospective Soil Health Economic Calculator (R-SHEC).** R-SHEC is an Excel-based tool which was used to quantify the benefits and costs experienced by already “soil health successful” producers in the majority of the case studies. AFT has released a version for row crops and one for almonds. The row crop version of R-SHEC is designed to evaluate the economic effects of implementing no-till or reduced tillage, cover crops, nutrient management, and conservation crop rotation. The almond version of the tool evaluates the economic effects of cover crops, nutrient management, compost application, and mulching. AFT also produced case studies using Cornell University’s Dairy Farm Business Summary (DFBS) survey. Two tools were used to calculate the environmental impacts of implementing soil health practices. The **USDA Nutrient Tracking Tool** was used to estimate water quality impacts, and **COMET-Farm** for calculating the change in GHG emissions. Both tools are described below. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read AFT’s Soil Health Case Studies Project Page AFT’s Soil Health Case Studies Methods page #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT’s Soil Health Benefits Training Session Webinar #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Cornell University’s Dairy Farm Business Summary (DFBS) Request free access to the R-SHEC tool ### Quantify Soil Health Outcomes **The economic impacts of soil health practices **The AFT-NRCS Soil Health Case Studies find that soil health successful farmers may experience net economic benefits, which can be achieved in two ways—through increases in income, through decreases in costs, or through a combination of the two. Increases in income can be attributed to yield increases. Decreases in costs, meanwhile, can be attributed to: The case studies demonstrate that net return on investment varies from farm to farm as, in some instances, the economic benefits of implementing soil health practices may be offset by decreases in income due to increased costs, such as the cost of purchasing seed for cover crops and the learning costs associated with implementing new practices. These increases in cost may be attributed to variable rate application; increased soil testing; learning costs associated with the transition in soil health management; new machinery; those associated with implementing cover crops, including seed, planting, and harvest costs. **The environmental impacts of soil health practices **In addition to the benefits to individual farm and ranch operations, improving soil health can also provide environmental benefits for society at large. These include climate change mitigation—healthy soils have the capacity to store more carbon—and improved water quality due to greater infiltration and water holding capacity in the soil leading to lower runoff from fields. Increased soil stability can reduce flood damage in surrounding communities. The **Nutrient Tracking Tool** can estimate reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment losses associated with implementing soil health practices. Climate benefits can be evaluated with the help of **COMET-Farm** , which estimates the ‘carbon footprint’ for all or part of a farm or ranch operation. It also allows users to evaluate different options for reducing GHG emissions and sequestering more carbon. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read AFT’s Soil Health Case Studies Findings Illinois Farm Soil Health Predictive Assessment Summary Report #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use AFT’s Soil Health Case Study Tool Kit Nutrient Tracking Tool COMET-Farm Soil Health Institute Resources ### Use the Case Study Findings When it comes to implementing new practices on producers’ land, it will be helpful to listen to farmers’ concerns; match examples of soil health success stories to the farm type and region; and be clear in your messaging and able to explain the basics of certain concepts, like partial budget analysis. There are a variety of barriers to adoption that producers may face when attempting to implement new practices on their land. These include: * Educational barriers, represented as learning costs in the case studies. * Financial barriers, such as the cost of new equipment and soil testing. * Technological barriers, including trial and error costs related to using new practices and machinery. * Technical barriers, including the learning curve for new practices and time spent fine tuning a new crop management system. * Agronomic barriers related to implementation of new cropping systems. * Belief that they would spend more to implement soil health practices. * Social barriers, including adjusting to a new way of farming. You can use the case studies to address these barriers. Pointing to “soil health successful” farmers who have navigated these challenges may help with normalizing adoption. Highlight the return on investment for a similar operation to alleviate financial concerns. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read Soil Health Institute: Economics of Soil Health Systems in Midwest Corn and Soy Washington State Extension: Soil Health in Orchards #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use AFT’s Soil Health Case Studies Basics Previous Resource Assessment Tools Next Sections Jump to Section 1. In-Field Assessment 2. Laboratory Assessment 3. Recognize Resource Concerns Go to top Collapse ## Resource Assessment Tools Agricultural landowners have access to a variety of soil evaluation tools. Most common is the standard soil tests, which provide farmers with information about soil nutrients. However, a standard soil test only tells part of the soil health story. A full soil health assessment looks at the biological and physical functioning of the soil in addition to the nutrient levels. The soil health assessment evaluates a range of soil health indicators. A soil health indicator is a soil property that provides information about the status of specific important soil processes. There are two methods of assessing indicators: an **in-field assessment** is a qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement and assesses indictors on the spot; a **laboratory assessment** measures quantitative indicators and is better for monitoring soil health. ### Learn about In-Field Soil Health Assessment NRCS staff can assist with assessing soil health in the field. This will include a field visit, a conversation with the farmer on management, and use of the **web soil survey**. A web soil survey provides information on soil’s inherent, nonmanagement-influenced properties. While this is useful for gauging a “baseline,” management is the primary driver of whether a resource concern is present. When looking at indicators of soil health in the field, it is important to keep in mind both the soil properties and the management practices being used. Below are six of the major indicators to look for when assessing soil health in the field: 1. One indicator of soil health is **aggregate stability**. Soil aggregate stability is related to soil porosity and how well soil can resist raindrop impact and erosion. To assess aggregate stability in the field, one can conduct a slake test, a strainer test, or a Jornada soil aggregate stability test. These tests reveal healthy soils if at least 80% of the soil mass remains intact in a slake test; if the sample “stands up” for strainer test and runoff water is translucent; or if it meets the Jornada test criteria. 2. **Plant roots and biopores** are another feature of healthy soils. Roots influence the soil immediately adjacent to them through exudates, growing and leaving soil organic matter as they die. Root systems and root channels can help address aggregate instability, soil organism habitat loss or degradation, and soil organic matter depletion. To assess this indicator of soil health in the field, look for evidence of dark root channels or biopores left by previous plants or earthworms. 3. Healthy soils will also have **adequate soil cover**. Soil cover is the percent of the soil surface that is covered by plant residue, organic mulch, or live plants. Having adequate soil cover can help address aggregate instability, soil organism habitat loss or degradation, soil organic matter depletion, and surface compaction. Soil cover can be measured in the field using farmer interview, the photo estimation method or state-approved method, or the line intercept method. If the soil is more than 75% covered after planting, it meets the criteria for adequate soil cover. 4. Another indicator is **surface crusts**. Crusts form after rain or irrigation on soils with weak aggregate stability. Surface crusts are an indicator of similar resource concerns as adequate soil cover. Crusts can be evaluated by visual observation after rainfall/irrigation and drying. Note whether crusts are throughout the field or only in patches. Near the surface, the soil will be dense and show layered sediment deposits. Poor crop emergence and uneven stand are also signs of surface crusts. Healthy soils should have surface crusts on 5% or less of the field. 5. Evidence of **ponding** can be another indicator of soil health. Ponding involves areas of the field that collect and hold runoff water from other parts of the field. Ponding may play a role in aggregate instability and surface compaction and can be measured by farmer interview or visual observation after rainfall or irrigation. Note evidence of crop residue deposits, evidence of ponding from observation or on recent aerial photos, and poor crop conditions, especially yellowing. Healthy soils should show evidence of ponding 24 hours or less after a typical rain event. 6. Another indicator or soil health is **penetration resistance** , or management-induced reduction of large pores and degraded structure (i.e., platy) that results in a decrease in root depth, plant growth, and soil biological habitat and activity. Penetration resistance contributes to aggregate instability, organic matter depletion, and surface compaction. To assess this feature of soil structure, one can evaluate multiple representative locations in the field, ideally when the soil moisture is near field capacity, and record the depths of restrictive layers and PSI readings, evaluate root development and distribution, and look for platy structure. In healthy soils, this evaluation should reveal granular structure, appropriate PSI readings, and vertical channels or roots. Health roots show unrestricted root growth and may have many fine roots. For further description of these soil health indicators, see the NRCS Cropland In-Field Soil Health Assessment Guide Technical Note. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read NRCS Cropland In-Field Soil Health Assessment Guide #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Using a penetrometer to detect soil compaction, UW Extension Soil Health Indicators: An Introductory Guide for Non-Operating Agricultural Landowners #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use NRCS Web Soil Survey How to Use the Web Soil Survey LandPKS Mobile App Cropland In-field Soil Health Assessment Worksheet ### Learn about a Laboratory Soil Health Assessment Lab tests will look for different indicators of soil health than in a field assessment. These indicators are standardized and have been chosen for their agronomic relevance. A laboratory test for soil health may evaluate these indicators: 1. **Soil structural stability and water partitioning**. An indicator of aggregate stability, this is an important part of water infiltration and determining available water capacity. 2. **Soil organic matter cycling** is an indicator of soil organic carbon. This assists with carbon cycling and sequestration. 3. **Carbon food source** , as permanganate oxidizable carbon (or active carbon). This active carbon is a source of food for essential soil organisms. 4. **Microbial activity** is an indicator of short-term carbon mineralization, or respiration. This reflects organism activity in the soil. 5. **Bioavailable nitrogen** is an acid citrate extractable protein. This is an indicator of an organically bound, environmentally stable soil nitrogen pool. For more information on lab indicators of soil health, see the NRCS Technical Note on Recommended Soil Health Indicators and Associated Laboratory Procedures. Regional calibration of soil health indicators is iterative and is now available for most indicators through the NRCS Soil Testing Conservation Activity 216. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read USDA NRCS Soil Health Assessment Webpage ### Recognize Soil Health Resource Concerns Once the properties of the soil have been identified through in-field or laboratory assessment, one can begin to address **soil health resource concerns**. NRCS defines a resource concern as “an existing or expected degradation of the soil, water, air, plant, or animal resource base to the extent that the sustainability or intended use of the resource is impaired.” These concerns can be addressed through soil health management planning. There are both short-term and long-term management options for improving soil health. For example, if the soil displays poor aggregate stability, this could be addressed immediately by incorporating fresh organic materials into the soil, using shallow-rooted crops or cover crops in these areas, and adding manure, green manure, or mulch to the field. Longer-term means of improving aggregate stability include reducing tillage, using surface mulch on fields, and rotating sod crops with mycorrhizal host plants. Once the appropriate management practices have been implemented in the field, the next steps are to observe the effects of the new practices and adapt management practices as needed. Conducting soil health assessments periodically allows for ongoing improvement to soil health as management practices are further refined and continually adapted to address the current conditions of the soil. Beyond helping to address resource constraints, a soil assessment can also: * Measure soil improvement or degradation from management practices over time * Facilitate applied research to identify successful soil health measures * Improve awareness of soil health and its benefits * Enable valuation of farmland based on management practices * Inform an assessment of farming system risk * Enable policy recommendations that are science-based #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT’s Resource Assessment Tools Training Webinar #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Operational Tillage Information System (OpTIS) #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/connect_66005e61.svg) Connect USDA Service Center Locator NRCS State Office Websites Benefits Previous COMET Tools Next Sections Jump to Section 1. COMET Components Go to top Collapse ## COMET Tools Soil health management practices, such as no-till and cover cropping, can build carbon levels in the soil in the form of soil organic matter. This organic matter provides nutrients for plants, improves soil structure, helps hold water, and moderates pathogen and pest pressure. These practices also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by drawing carbon into the soil. In this way, soil health management practices can both make soils more resilient and adaptive—a plus for farmers—and mitigate the effects of climate change. COMET, which stands for **C** arb **O** n **M** anagement **E** missions **T** ool, is an online platform designed for agricultural producers who are interested in adopting climate-beneficial practices. COMET helps producers and those who work with producers to estimate the climate benefits of farm management practices. ### Identify Carbon Management Emissions Tool Components COMET is comprised of several components: COMET-Energy, COMET-Planner, and COMET-Farm. COMET offers many training resources, such as those that can help one decide which COMET component to use. The COMET components continue to be updated regularly. **COMET-Planner** COMET-Planner is a quick and easy assessment that provides estimates of the GHG mitigation impacts of implementing conservation practices. It is intended to be used for planning purposes. It is based on a larger-scale area, estimating impacts over Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs). A positive value generated by COMET-Planner represents an increase in carbon sequestered **or** decrease in GHG emissions. A negative value generated would represent either a decrease in sequestered carbon **or** an increase in GHG emissions. Watch the COMET-Planner Demonstration for an overview of how to use this tool. The output of the COMET-Planner calculator will be in tons of CO2 sequestered or released. To make sense of this number, the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator can be used to translate tons of CO2 into more concrete terms, such as the annual CO2 emissions of cars, households, and power plants. This component can be useful in communicating when developing a conservation plan or evaluating targets. **COMET-Farm** COMET-Farm is an in-depth, site-based, whole farm assessment that accounts for soil properties, weather, farming systems, and management strategies. COMET- Farm can be used for all types of operations, including more complex production systems. The COMET-Farm tool requires more input on the front end, so may take more time to set up, but the reports generated by the tool are more detailed, providing users with projected estimates of baseline “business as usual” emissions, future management scenario emissions, and the change in emissions between these two scenarios. **COMET-Energy** COMET-Energy allows one to calculate the reductions in GHG emissions based on fuel savings. This would often be used as a supplement to COMET-Planner or COMET-Farm because some of the practices in these tools do not incorporate fuel savings. You can enter annual energy savings in gallons, CCF, or kilowatts and COMET-Energy will generate a summary of energy savings, measured either in MMBTU or CO2-reduced. The COMET suite has provided the groundwork for additional tools for identifying GHG-reducing agricultural practices. For example, the USDA’s Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF) Mitigation Activities List, which includes 13 practices that have a quantifiable mitigative benefit, is informed by the COMET platform. The COMET emissions calculations also inform the Carbon Reduction Potential Evaluation Tool (CaRPE), a tool designed by AFT and ARS scientists to estimate how we can maximize the benefits of soil health practices, including those on the CSAF Mitigation Activities List, by increasing adoption. Estimates can then be scaled-up from the county-level to state, regional, and national levels (see AFT’s CaRPE Briefs for States). #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read COMET-Planner Report AFT’s CaRPE Briefs for States #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT’s COMET Tools Training Webinar COMET-Farm and COMET-Planner Introductory Video #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use COMET-Planner Tool COMET-Farm Tool COMET-Energy Tool CaRPE Tool Resource Assessment Tools Previous Engaging Landowners and Operators Next Sections Jump to Section 1. Building Farmer Networks 2. Soil Health Messengers 3. One-on-One Communication 4. Wider Communication Go to top Collapse ## Engaging Landowners and Operators As land protection professionals, considering strategies for tactful communication and relationship-building is key to engaging with producers. This is especially true when it comes to guiding farmers towards the adoption of new practices. ### Building Farmer Networks Farmer networks are an important—and often trusted—source of information for producers. Building networks for producers and tapping into existing farmer networks can be effective ways to communicate information related to land management and conservation practice implementation. This may involve collaborating with leaders in the agricultural community to build social norms and to leverage trusted information-sharing networks. You may also want to prioritize farmer-led resources when communicating with a producer, such as pointing them to field days or farmer-led organizations in their area. As you work to establish these networks and producer relationships, it is helpful to recognize farmers’ other trusted information sources and think about how these sources can be integrated into the network. Farmers may rely on neighbors, local farmers’ cooperatives, their local land trust, cooperative extension services, or their local NRCS office for information. One example of a farmer network is the Genesee River Demonstration Farms Network in Western New York State. This partnership, spearheaded by AFT and NRCS, involves collaboration between researchers, agricultural and conservation organizations, and the farming community within the Genesee River Watershed. The goal of the network is to allow farms in the region to learn from one another and to see which practices are most cost effective and have the biggest impact on conservation. A soil health evaluation is conducted on the network farms to identify the resource constraints and understand the impacts of management techniques. The network’s participants are invited to share their stories and findings in online webinars and in-person field days. Demonstration plot videos and online documentation of the field trials help make demonstrations more widely available. The findings from several of the demonstration farms are captured in the New York. The case studies can be used by farmers and the members of the farm conservation community to learn about the costs and benefits of adopting soil health practices and the potential for a return on investment. This information ideally gives farmers the confidence to adopt soil health practices that will increase farm resilience and viability, lessen agricultural impacts on water resources, and address climate change. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read AFT's Soil Health Case Studies Genesee River Demonstration Farms Network Report #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/connect_66005e61.svg) Connect Genesee River Demonstration Farms Network ### Identifying Soil Health Messengers Finding producers willing and well-positioned to participate in a farmer demonstration network can play an important role in a network’s success. These producers will serve as “messengers” for the network, leading communication within their communities around on-farm practices and demonstration findings. The following are qualities to keep in mind when identifying these network messengers: * Key leaders in an agricultural community will likely be well-connected and well-respected by other producers. * Farmers who have expressed an interest in soil health and its environmental benefits may be more open to adopting new practices on their operation. * Those who have been farming for multiple years may have experiences that are seen as being more credible. * Producers with good recordkeeping can provide valuable information on their operation over time. * Farmers who have implemented soil health practices with significant “before and after” contrasts will have more impactful stories to convey. * A producer with other conservation practices in place or one who implements best practices may have an operation more readily able to serve as a model farm. * Participants must be willing to share their experience publicly—including what _didn’t_ work on their farm. * Ideal participants are willing to travel and speak about their process in front of their peers. Finding producers prepared to serve as soil health messengers and building relationships with these partners will take time. Patience is key! To begin identifying these essential communicators, you may want to tap into existing networks. It can help to have a running list of producers in the area who fit the requirements and/or have expressed interest in sharing their experiences and expertise. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read AFT’s Soil Health Farmer Profiles ### Communicating One-on-One with Producers Strategic communication around soil health practices can make information sharing with farmers more effective. Approaching your outreach as an opportunity to foster a relationship with a farmer may help to build a foundation of trust; you can then provide information as appropriate. At any stage in your communications, keep in mind that soil health is likely just one part of the bigger picture for the producer, who may be navigating multiple, concurrent day-to-day challenges on their farm. The following are specific strategies for communicating with producers about soil health: 1. _Provide evidence of soil health practice benefits_. When communicating with a producer about the benefits of implementing soil health practices, it may be helpful to have specific examples to point to, either from a local farmer or publications such as AFT’s Soil Health Case Studies. When visiting a farm or speaking in-person, having a printout of the information to leave with the farmer allows them to revisit the resources on their own time. In addition to printouts, podcasts, YouTube, and other more widely accessible (and “multi-taskable”) resources may prove helpful for producers with limited time. Pointing to specific resources may also help to address common misconceptions around soil health practices. 2. _Tailor your message to the farm and their specific concerns_. One way to approach the conversation is by asking the farmer about their recent successes and challenges. This allows you to acknowledge what is working well for them. If the producer seems receptive, you can offer suggestions in response to their identified challenges. Having knowledge of the programs and practices most relevant to your audience may result in more meaningful conversation. You can also bring prior knowledge of a producer’s operation into the conversation. For example: Do they have highly erodible land? Do they have more than one crop in rotation? If so, your audience may be more receptive to implementing soil health practices, as both are shown to be predictors of conservation practice adoption. Considering the terminology being used by the producer is another means of tailoring the conversation to your audience. For example, farmers may speak of weather-related challenges, without talking about climate change. In that case, building on-farm resiliency in the face of extreme weather might be one entry point to discussing soil health. Lastly, keep in mind that the farm is their livelihood, so when providing suggestions or talking about soil health, it can be a personal conversation. 3. _Build trust over time with your audience_. Approach your conversations with producers as a partner, and be sure to indicate support, especially when offering input or suggestions—avoid telling the farmer how to farm. Offering to tour the property with the landowner or producer may make for more impactful visits and if there are issues to be addressed, talking through concerns can be more productive in a face-to-face meeting. If you represent the entity responsible for monitoring an easement, let the producer know ahead of time when you’ll be visiting the farm, and invite them to join you. To avoid the intimidation factor, you could have a third party, such as another producer from the area, join for the inspection as well. If possible, having one staff member from a monitoring entity who specializes in building long-term relationships with producers in the area can help to facilitate trust. Lastly, having patience is important. Keep in mind that farmer decision making is complex, and you likely won’t convince a producer to overhaul their practices with one visit. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read Communicating with your Landowner ### Communicating to a Wider Audience While one-on-one conversations may be the most direct means of relaying information, other forms of communication may be more effective in sharing about soil health practices with a broader audience. In particular, field days are a good way to communicate information to producers in a region and demonstrate what practices are working for other farmers in their area. Below are some tips for organizing a field day: * Consider the time of the year: farmers might have more time to attend a field day in the winter, though there may be less in production on the farm. So for farm demonstrations, the end of August may also be a good time, as the visit may be more impactful if participants can see the operation in full swing. * Look for producer contact lists: some states have lists of producer contacts for purchase for a nominal fee. * Communicate through different avenues: in addition to digital promotion of your field day, consider sending out postcards or mailings to reach a wider audience. * Have partners: invite partner organizations to present and have them help with outreach. This may make for a more engaging field day and assist with attracting a wider audience. * Consider your audience: pick topics that are relevant to farmers in the area and vary the topics and presenters if planning for multiple field days. * Engage producers: having a farmer panel where producers can share their experience may be valuable, as they can speak to the concerns and interests of farmers in the area. * Keep it brief: depending on the size and demonstration, allotting four hours for your field day should be plenty. Providing lunch or coffee and unstructured time for farmers to talk to each other can be valuable. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT’s Engaging Landowners Training Webinar COMET Tools Previous Working with Diverse Owners and Operators Next Sections Jump to Section 1. Working with Diverse Owners and Operators 2. Owner and Operator Demographics 3. Connect with Diverse Audiences Go to top Collapse ## Reaching and Working with Diverse Owners and Operators ### Understanding the challenges specific to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color—or BIPOC—landowners and producers; women landowners and producers; and operators with insecure land tenure is a crucial step towards working with and supporting these groups. The USDA and many states use “socially disadvantaged” to refer to some of these producer groups. The USDA defines socially disadvantaged as “a farmer or rancher who is a member of one or more of the following groups whose members have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities.” Note that women aren’t usually included in this definition of “socially disadvantaged”, unless they also fall into one of the following groups: * African Americans * American Indians * Alaskan Natives * Asians * Hispanics * Pacific Islanders * Veterans #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT's Working with Diverse Owners and Operators Training Webinar ### Examine Owner and Operator Demographics A closer look at landowner and operator demographics can offer insight into the challenges faced by underrepresented and minority producers and landowners in the U.S. **Women in Agriculture** Nearly 40 percent of farmland in the U.S. is rented or leased out by non- operating landlords, or NOLs. Given this, NOLs are an important audience to engage in farmland protection. Research shows that many NOLs have a high level of trust in their farm operators and may be willing to make changes to support conservation practices. Most importantly, many of these NOLs want to keep farmland in farming. Despite this, NOLs tend to be under-represented and under-engaged in farmland protection programs. This is particularly true of women landowners, which is significant given that nearly 40 percent of NOLs are women, and in some parts of the U.S., the proportion of women NOLs is closer to 50 percent. On the operator side, close to 36 percent of the country’s producers are women, and more than half of all farms in the U.S. have a principal female producer. Counties with the highest proportion of female-operated farms are largely in the West and Northeast U.S. Women-run farms, on average, operate on smaller acreage and earn 40 percent less farm income than those operated by men, after controlling for farm and operator characteristics. Childcare responsibilities, compounded by a lack of access to childcare, may limit women’s ability to advance their skills and expand their farm operation. While farming is still one of the most unequal professions in the U.S. in terms of gender diversity, a growing portion of new and beginning farmers identify as women and/or as racially or ethnically diverse. With around 40 percent of farmland due to change hands over the next two decades, this indicates we can expect a more diverse future for agriculture, with more women present in the industry. **BIPOC Producers and Landowners** Heirs’ property is when land is not clearly delineated to future heirs and so there are many people with claim to the land. This makes the land susceptible to conversion to non-farm uses and poses legal and financial challenges that can prevent the land from being held by the family, who, in many instances, are BIPOC or low-income. Heirs’ property disputes often require a lawyer to facilitate a resolution in the courts. Some states have adopted the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, which provides additional due process protections for heirs. You can see if your state has adopted this act using the Uniform Law Commission’s dashboard. Heirs’ property impacts about 3.5 million acres across the Southern U.S. and pertains to more than one third of Black-owned land in the South. This is a critical issue that affects the ability of Black farmers to hold on to the land, and to think about the long-term protection and stewardship of that land. It is estimated that 90 percent of the land that was in the hands of African American families in the 1900s has been lost to these families. Today, less than two percent of agricultural landowners in the U.S. are non-white. Compounding this, Black farmers have historically experienced discrimination in getting support from federal farm programs. Efforts to address land loss—in the form of land return, reparations, and rematriation—are being made; resources for more information on these efforts are linked. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read AFT's The State of Gender Equity in U.S. Agriculture AFT's Understanding and Activating Non-Operating Landowners Read about Indigenous land loss here #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Listen to this NPR story on heirs' property Uniform Law Commission’s Partition of Heirs’ Property Act Page Women, Food & Agriculture Network's Online Resources for Women Landowners #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/connect_66005e61.svg) Connect AFT's Women for the Land Initiative Freedmen Heirs Foundation Soil Sisters ### Connect with Diverse Audiences Whether working with producers, NOLs, or other diverse audiences, listening to the needs of your collaborator is important. Understanding and respecting differences in experience, while highlighting shared goals, can go a long way in connecting diverse audiences and building networks of trusted advisors. As a part of this network building, it is crucial to consider who are the trusted leaders in a space, and whether there are existing networks that your collaborators already turn to. In outreach and education, it is worth considering whether diverse audiences see themselves in the existing resources. Uplifting the stories of the “average” producer—not only those who excel—and highlighting work that may be happening in more incremental steps—rather than extraordinary successes—is also important for connecting with those who have historically been under- engaged and under-represented in the agriculture and conservation spheres. For NOLs, outlining incremental steps towards conservation may help engage those who think of themselves as an “outsider” in the conservation and/or landownership realm. Ultimately, to center the work of BIPOC, women, and other minority groups in agriculture, we not only need to rethink the “success” stories being told, but also the very metrics for success. Results-oriented initiatives that prioritize cost- or time-saving deliverables may overlook the often- marginalized work of under-represented groups in agriculture. Instead, orienting initiatives towards long-term results, recognizing incremental change, and grounding goals in the experience and knowledge of diverse producers and landowners can foster more inclusive work. Some questions to consider as you strive to engage more diverse producers and landowners in your work include: * How are you currently engaging socially disadvantaged producers and landowners in farmland protection? How might you further this work? * What challenges will you face doing this work? * What opportunities might arise from further engaging in this work? * What entities might you partner with to make this work more impactful? * What training or resources do you have or need to advance this work? #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read Read more about land return and related resources via Sogorea Te’ Land Trust Read more about land reparations and existing efforts via Soul Fire Farm Wallowa Land Trust's program for Indigenous land access #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use University of Maryland Extension’s Beginning Farmer Success Project resources Virginia Cooperative Extension’s Small Farm Outreach Program resources #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/connect_66005e61.svg) Connect Black Family Land Trust Carter Farms E Resources Group Groundswell Conservancy Engaging Landowners and Operators Previous ACEs and Management Plans Next Sections Jump to Section 1. Encouraging Conservation in Easements 2. Management Plans 3. Integrate Soil Health 4. Agricultural Leases Go to top Collapse ## Agricultural Conservation Easements and Referenced Plans to Encourage Soil Health Agricultural land protection practitioners are finding ways to promote soil health practices with owners of permanently protected agricultural land. Learn about key considerations as you work to encourage conservation goals through permanent conservation easements. Deepen your understanding of NRCS conservation plans and other resource management plans and learn how these plans can be adapted to engage producers and landowners around soil health. Lastly, learn ways agricultural leases can better support adoption of soil health practices. ### Encouraging Conservation in Easements To encourage conservation outcomes, including those that support soil health, entities initiate conversations with their landowners about their conservation goals. Some have developed educational resources that highlight the benefits of management plans. Others use questionnaires to better understand landowner priorities. In addition, easement holders tend to: **Focus on outcomes instead of practices.** Many easement holders use deed language that focuses on conservation outcomes in the purpose section and sections about allowable agricultural uses and activities. They may also recommend or require management in accordance with a referenced plan. This approach provides a more flexible alternative to naming specific practices or management systems. It allows for changes to the operation and recognizes that best management practices can evolve over time. **Require plans to be developed by qualified conservation professionals.** Effective conservation planning requires technical expertise. To ensure that referenced management plans address specific resource concerns, be sure to engage qualified professionals. NRCS certifies other conservation professionals, including staff with conservation districts, who can provide technical service activities according to NRCS standards and specifications for conservation activities. These professionals are certified Technical Service Providers and listed in a registry maintained by NRCS (see below). **Use monitoring as an opportunity to encourage conservation.** Practitioners consider their capacity to monitor and enforce conservation provisions over time. Some require plan implementation if it is necessary for compliance with federal or state laws or if the plan was developed to address an easement violation. Some experienced entities with requirements found it helpful to set up a transparent process for review and enforcement of compliance with a plan. For example, some organizations require mediation and use a qualified third party to help ease tensions while ensuring the resource is protected. Other organizations, view the management plan primarily as a tool to initiate conversations with producers and landowners and to _encourage_ improvements. Therefore, during monitoring visits practitioners focus on landowner education and noting progress toward their conservation goals #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read NRCS Nine Step Planning Process #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use NRCS Registry of Technical Service Providers #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Soil Health Stewards Session Videos ### Learn About Management Plans Referenced management plans are the most common approach for easement holders to achieve conservation outcomes while providing flexibility for agricultural producers. These plans may apply to portions of or the entire protected area and may satisfy state or federal requirements or may be implemented to advance the entity’s conservation goals. Several public easement holders and private land trusts and public entities include language in the easement enabling them to work directly with conservation professionals to initiate planning. **NRCS Conservation Plans** A Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conservation plan helps producers and landowners adopt practices and activities that support agricultural production while safeguarding the land and other natural resources. NRCS conservation planners develop plans in collaboration with farmers and ranchers or people who own land used for agriculture. In the case of rented land, either party can request a field visit by NRCS. NRCS uses a multi-step planning process to identify individuals’ conservation objectives, assess site conditions and identify natural resource concerns. The process also outlines practices and activities, which are listed in the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide for each state, to address resource concerns. Planners record decisions made by producers or landowners. NRCS reviews the effectiveness of the plan over time. In general, NRCS planning assistance is free to farmers or ranchers and agricultural landowners. Most conservation planning efforts, however, are tied to the agency’s priorities as established by state technical committees. These advisory committees may prioritize certain resource concerns, places, or other outcomes within a state. NRCS conservation planning activities also are linked to implementation of the agency’s financial assistance programs. In some counties, individuals who want a conservation plan are placed on a waiting list. As noted above, NRCS also certifies TSPs, who can provide technical service activities according to NRCS standards and specifications for conservation activities. NRCS lists TSPs in their registry. **Entity Management Plans** Farmland protection entities, like land trusts or state or local governments, also develop and help producers and landowners implement resource management plans. Some entities have in-house conservation planners; others hire qualified conservation professionals. Farmland protection entities may or may not use NRCS standards and specifications to inform their plans. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read NRCS Nine Step Planning Process #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Field Office Technical Guides NRCS Registry of Technical Service Providers #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Soil Health Stewards Session Videos ### Integrate Soil Health A management plan can enable you to initiate conversations about soil health. You can talk to operators and agricultural landowners with existing plans about adding specific soil health goals and working with conservation planners to identify practices to accomplish them. **Soil Health Management Plan** A Soil Health Management Plan (SHMP) is special kind of management plan that identifies concerns related to the physical, biological and chemical properties of the soil. It provides a framework for working with producers and landowners to adopt activities that will help them maintain or improve the health of the soil on a specific site. NRCS has developed the specifications and standards for a SHMP but does not typically offer this type of planning assistance. Entities, however, can engage a TSP to develop a SHMP. To address soil health, conservation planners pay close attention to land that is prone to erosion (i.e., highly erodible land) but NRCS now also considers soil organic matter depletion; aggregate instability; and habitat loss for organisms living in the soil. Planners will propose practices to address identified resource concerns. Then producers and landowners decide what they are able and willing to do, and the plan specifies how the practices will be implemented. Entities can monitor the practices and activities over time to track progress toward meeting soil health goals. A key consideration for producers, landowners and easement holders are the costs to implement practices and measure outcomes over time. NRCS has compiled a practice scenario guide for each state that provides estimated costs. TSPs usually know if NRCS has prioritized SHMPs and the practices in the plan in each state. If it is a priority, then cost share would be available. ### Use Agricultural Leases to Encourage Conservation Agricultural leases are legal contracts between a property owner and a tenant that gives the tenant the right to use the land for agricultural purposes for a set period of time. Permanently protected agricultural land may be owned by non-operating landowners or farmers and ranchers who rent their land for agricultural use. The lease agreement outlines the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract aims to protect both parties and help them achieve their goals. This can include improving soil health. Easement holders can support the development of leases that enhance soil health and by talking to conservation professionals, including soil and water conservation district staff and NRCS, learning about applicable conservation practices and programs, and talking to landowners about their goals. In addition, easement holders can share information about ways to encourage adoption of practices that improve soil health in agricultural leases. Key strategies to support conservation on rented land include: 1. **Establishing regular, open communication.** Regular conversations between the landowner and farmer or rancher enable the parties to clarify goals and reach agreement on how to achieve them. To get started, farmers can ask landowners about their future plans for the land. Landowners can ask producers what can be done to reduce erosion or what they would do to protect the soils on their own land. Farmland protection entities can help set up and facilitate these conversations. 1. **Extending the length of the agreement.** Short leases discourage the adoption of conservation practices. Therefore, one of the easiest ways for landowners to encourage conservation is to extend the lease term. Landowners can give producers more time on the land, linking the length of the lease to the time needed to establish and benefit from selected practices. Some experienced easement holders suggest phasing in a longer-term lease when working with a new farmer or rancher. 1. **Setting specific farming standards.** Landowners can be clear about how they expect the land to be managed. The lease can include standards established by state departments of agriculture, soil and water conservation districts and/or practices recommended in an conservation plan. If specific practices are expected, these can be stipulated and defined in the lease to create clear expectations for both parties and help head off confusion. 1. **Considering the cost of adoption.** Landowners should consider the costs associated with conservation practices, which includes the expense of implementing, short-term impacts on profits and the cost to maintain practices over time. Consider if the farmer has the necessary equipment to implement the proposed practices. Landowners can encourage adoption by discounting rent, sharing program payments and offering non-monetary incentives like a longer lease. Landowners should learn about the tax treatment of program payments to help inform negotiations. 1. **Reviewing and revising the agreement.** Agree to review and revise the lease on a regular basis. Consider who will have the right to inspect the property and ensure that practices are being implemented. The lease will only work to encourage conservation if it reflects what is happening on the ground. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read University of Maryland Agricultural Conservation Leasing Guide Sustainable Farm Leasing: Quick Reference Guide Working with Diverse Owners and Operators Previous Technical and Financial Resources Next Sections Jump to Section 1. NRCS Conservation Technical Assistance 2. NRCS Financial Assistance Programs Go to top Collapse ## Connecting Producers and Landowners to Soil Health Technical and Financial Resources Familiarity with the technical and financial assistance programs offered by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) can prove helpful for land protection practitioners who work directly with farmers, ranchers, and landowners. These programs support the implementation of conservation practices, including those that improve soil health, so being able to direct producers and landowners to these resources may improve the likelihood of soil health practice adoption on the land. ### NRCS Conservation Technical Assistance USDA NRCS provides one-on-one guidance to operators and landowners on conservation techniques and tools via Conservation Technical Assistance, or CTA. The technical assistance offered through CTA often leads to the development of a conservation plan, which is a system of practices that addresses identified resource concerns and the needs of the producer. Resource concerns are issues related to natural resources on the farm that can be improved through conservation practices. Conservation planning is the foundation for NRCS financial assistance: producers or landowners applying for these programs work with NRCS state staff to either revise an existing conservation plan or develop a new plan that identifies the natural resource concerns specific to their operation. Those who work with NRCS to implement conservation plans may be directed toward NRCS financial assistance programs, should their resource concerns align with available funding. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read NRCS Conservation Planning #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use NRCS Web Soil Survey #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch AFT’s Soil Health Technical and Financial Resources Webinar ### NRCS Financial Assistance Programs USDA NRCS offers several financial assistance programs for implementing conservation practices, all of which can be accessed through the NRCS Conservation Program Application. This section focuses on EQIP and CSP, two NRCS programs that most directly address implementation of conservation practices on working lands. **Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)** EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for implementing practices that address natural resource concerns and improve working lands. Through EQIP, NRCS works one-on-one with to producers and landowners to install NRCS- approved conservation practices, many of which support soil health. Under EQIP, each NRCS conservation practice has an associated payment rate, which is the rate at which producers will be reimbursed for implementation. In addition to NRCS national resource concern priorities, each state also maintains a list of priority conservation practices for funding; applications that address national and/or state conservation priorities will generally be ranked higher for funding. EQIP also offers higher payment rates for historically underserved participants, including socially disadvantaged, beginning, limited resource, and veteran beginning farmers. **Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)** Producers who have already implemented conservation practices and want to build upon their efforts can enroll in CSP. Through CSP, NRCS works with producers to develop a conservation plan that _enhances_ existing practices. CSP participants earn payments for maintaining their existing conservation work and for incorporating new conservation practices and/or enhancements into their operation. For example, a producer who plants cover crops may choose to enhance this practice by incorporating multi-species or deep-rooting cover crops. Through both EQIP and CSP, NRCS technical assistance is offered at no cost. NRCS Technical Service Providers help enrolled producers with developing conservation activity plans to improve their operations, and with planning, designing, and implementing conservation practices. More information on these programs can be found on the NRCS EQIP and CSP pages online. **Applying to NRCS Conservation Programs** A landowner or producer interested in EQIP or CSP should reach out to their local NRCS field office. NRCS staff or a conservation planner can work with them to evaluate the current management system, natural resource concerns, and the resources available to them. When applying for a conservation program, the producer, the land, and the practice must all meet NRCS eligibility criteria. Field office staff can assist prospective applicants with determining eligibility. Before receiving financial assistance through NRCS, the producer or landowner will also need to establish farm and producer records with the Farm Service Agency (FSA). NRCS can work with an applicant to establish their farm records. Once a landowner or producer decides to apply, they can submit a Conservation Program Application (NRCS-CPA-1200) to their local field office and NRCS will work with them to either revise an existing conservation plan or develop a new conservation plan. Keep in mind that states announce sign-up deadlines for consideration for funding. There are typically multiple continuous cut-off dates for each program. Applications may be prioritized through a screening process to identify those that have maximum conservation benefits. Applications are then ranked based on alignment with national and state resource concerns. The highest-ranking applications are selected for funding, until available funding is exhausted. An accepted application results in a contract. The participant then arranges to install, implement, or construct the practices. After implementation, NRCS field staff will certify the implementation/installation prior to authorizing reimbursement. The producer is expected to maintain the practice for the duration of the practice lifespan specified by NRCS. **Funding Opportunities for Entities** NRCS also offers partnership programs geared towards entities. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), which addresses natural resource concerns on agricultural land, is one such program. When an organization applies for RCPP funding, they identify the specific resource concerns they want to address and the value of cash or in-kind contributions they can provide as match. Landowners can then apply to the funded RCPP projects in their region if their resource conservation concerns align with the project. Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) is another program for entities. CIG is a targeted grant program; proposed projects must meet the description of innovative conservation projects or activities published in the annual funding notice. State Departments of Agriculture or Departments of Natural Resources may also offer funding to entities or landowners to do conservation work. By maximizing existing sources of conservation funding, an entity can better support landowners implementing soil health practices. Offering producer grants designed to supplement existing sources of funding is another way entities can make the most of available conservation dollars. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read USDA Conservation Assistance at Farmers.gov NRCS Programs & Initiatives #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use State Conservation Program Dashboard NRCS Conservation Programs Applications and Forms NRCS Application Ranking Dates by State NRCS Payment Schedules (Rates) by State #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/connect_66005e61.svg) Connect Land Grant University and Extension Directory USDA Service Center Locator ACEs and Management Plans Previous Ecosystem Markets Next Sections Jump to Section 1. Ecosystem Markets 2. Role of Farms 3. Considerations Go to top Collapse ## Leveraging Ecosystem Markets to Finance Soil Health Practices Private sources of funding, including ecosystem markets, provide another tool for scaling soil health systems on agricultural land. Ecosystem markets—and specifically carbon markets—have expanded in recent years, so if you are a land protection practitioner who works with farmers and landowners, you may be getting questions from your partners about how these markets work, and whether they are eligible to participate. ### Ecosystem Markets **Ecosystem markets** involve payments to landowners to protect, restore, or mitigate impacts to ecosystems. This exchange is usually between an entity that has a negative ecosystem impact and an entity that has a corresponding positive impact. The following section will focus primarily on carbon markets. Carbon markets trade in **carbon credits** —the measurable reduction of GHG emissions from an activity or project that is used to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. Typically, credits are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, or CO2e. Carbon markets involve a buyer and a seller. Corporations are typically the “buyers” and farmers implementing climate-beneficial practices are a “seller” in carbon markets. Agriculture and forestry are the only economic sectors that naturally sequester carbon in plants, trees, and soils. Carbon market developers “broker” the transaction of carbon credits between buyers and sellers. These entities match carbon sources, like corporations, with carbon sinks, like farms. Different entities will have different focuses within ecosystem markets, as well as different incentives, varied payment structures, and different levels of technical support. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read Top 10 Things You Wanted to Know About Agricultural Carbon Markets #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Leveraging Public and Private Funding to Help Finance Soil Health Practices ### The Role of Farms in Carbon Markets Current research suggests that some cropland management practices, including those that support soil health, can sequester carbon, making farmland an important carbon sink. As of 2022, there are over 380 million acres of cropland in the U.S., presenting farmers with a unique opportunity to increase soil carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions—all while improving water quality, building on‐farm resiliency, and supporting profitability. Cover cropping and no-till are two examples of practices that store carbon and benefit soil health. Farmers who are interested in taking part in carbon markets may wonder how much carbon their farm can store. This depends on a variety of factors, including farm- and field-level characteristics such as soil type, climate, and topography. The management systems in place, including crop rotations, the depth of tillage, and residue and nutrient management, may also make a difference. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/read_bbd22b01.svg) Read Combating Climate Change on US Cropland #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use Carbon Reduction Potential Evaluation Tool ### Considerations Prior to Entering an Ecosystem Market For farmers who are considering participating in an ecosystem market, there are a variety of factors that will determine which market is the right fit for them. Keep in mind that, depending on the operation, the farmer may receive higher rates for implementing certain practices, like no-till and cover cropping, through an incentive program like EQIP as opposed to a carbon market. Ecosystem markets could make sense for a farmer who was already planning to implement a new practice on their operation, but market payments alone may not be sufficient to justify on-farm management changes. In some cases it is possible to “stack” benefits, that is, to get a carbon market payment on top of a public program payment, such as through EQIP. This may increase the return on investment for implementing a new practice. If you’re working with a landowner who is thinking about entering a carbon market, also be sure that they are informed when it comes to: * Their goals for participating in carbon markets, and the payments they would receive. * The management changes that would be required of their operation to sequester a certain amount of carbon. * The level of technical support they would need and what types of support are available through the market. * The record keeping requirements that are necessary for participation in these markets. **Preparing Producers to Participate in a Carbon Market** For those who _are_ ready to enter an ecosystem market, it may be too early to enroll the whole farm—these markets are evolving, so you might suggest that the farmer enroll a few fields at a time. When entering into a market, a producer will ideally be prepared with some conservation agronomy resources, as they will need technical assistance with the transition to conservation farming. You can also encourage producers to get their farm records ready, as having detailed data is key to receiving the highest payment rates. Lastly, when it comes time to review a contract, the producer should read the fine print, and ideally will have a lawyer review a contract with them prior to entering a carbon market. In particular, contract items to consider include: * Does enrollment in a carbon market limit eligibility for other financial incentives? Generally, private and public sources of funding can be stacked, but this may not always be the case. * Contract length, and whether there is a penalty for breaking the contract early. * Whether rented lands are eligible to enroll in the market, and if so, how the program is structured with regards to the landowner and the renter. * Price stability or price caps: payment schedules may be subject to market volatility, or a producer may be locked into the contract incentive rate. * Privacy and data management transparency. * Verification fees or other hidden fees. In particular, find out who is paying the costs for third party verification. And above all, ensure that you aren’t jeopardizing your trust or relationship with the producer when discussing programs like carbon markets, as there are still some significant caveats related to these markets. Specifically, much of the research to date has been conducted on surface soils, which leaves questions as to what carbon storage looks like deeper in the soil profile. Practice permanence is also an issue, as sequestration is only of benefit if the carbon is stored indefinitely. Ecosystem markets are also a rapidly changing landscape, with new partnerships still forming. Many entities currently involved have rolled out pilot phases in different areas and are still in the process of determining what the full roll-out of their market looks like. Given these uncertainties, practitioners and producers will be best served to approach these markets cautiously. #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/use_c8c5c401.svg) Use ISAP’s Ecosystem Market Comparison #### ![Image:](https://farmlandinfo.org/wp- content/themes/fic/dist/images/watch_b41a24d5.svg) Watch Farming for the Future: A Forum Exploring Ecosystem Markets Technical and Financial Resources Previous ## We Are Here to Help #### On-Farm Conservation Understand the value of natural resources and take action to protect them.

Water is the most common limiting factor for many crops in Ohio. Too much water can also be a problem, leading to standing water, erosion, and nutrient loss. A soil with a low water holding capacity will have a narrow window between too much and not enough moisture. Both conditions lead to poor plant growth. ### Organic Matter Increased soil organic matter enhances your soil's ability to absorb water, leading to less water stress during both dry and wet periods. This can be achieved by: * Incorporate compost, manures, or other stable organic materials. * Grow and incorporate a high biomass cover crop. * Add a perennial crop to your rotation. * Add a sod crop to your rotation. * Reduce tillage to provide less disturbance to soil biota and structure. ### **Mulch** Mulches are useful for retaining soil moisture under dry conditions. Common sources of mulches include hay, straw, cut forage, wood chips or shredded bark, or plastic. Mulches can provide additional benefits such as weed control or organic matter, but may also come with potential drawbacks. Several cover crop varieties can be interseeded and used as living mulches, but can also provide competition for limited water and nutrients. Mulches can also be expensive and/or time consuming to purchase, apply, and dispose of. Mulches with a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio may tie up soil nitrogen supplies. If not carefully sourced, mulches may also introduce weed seeds and disease. Keep in mind that a mulch's ability to retain moisture and cool temperatures may not be welcomed year-round. Cooler soil temperature can slow germination or plant growth and soils prone to flooding or pooling will experience standing water more readily when mulched. ## Search form Search ## Have a soil health question? ## ![Image: A call out with a question mark.](https://soilhealth.osu.edu/sites/soilhealth/files/imce/Images/question_callout.png) Soil health experts at The Ohio State University will address your question(s). ## Locate An Office We connect with people in all stages of life, from young children to older adults.

Home 2. Conservation Basics 3. Natural Resource Concerns 4. Soil Health 5. Soil Health Assessment Soil health is an assessment of how well soil performs all of its functions now and how those functions are being preserved for future use. Soil health cannot be determined by measuring only crop yield, water quality, or any other single outcome. Soil health cannot be measured directly, so we evaluate indicators. Indicators are measurable properties of soil or plants that provide clues about how well the soil can function. Indicators can be physical, chemical, and biological properties, processes, or characteristics of soils. They can also be morphological or visual features of plants. **Useful indicators:** * are easy to measure, * measure changes in soil functions, * encompass chemical, biological, and physical properties, * are accessible to many users and applicable to field conditions, and * are sensitive to variations in climate and management. Indicators can be assessed by qualitative or quantitative techniques. After measurements are collected, they can be evaluated by looking for patterns and comparing results to measurements taken at a different time or field. ### Indicator Examples and Relationship to Soil Health * Soil organic matter => nutrient retention; soil fertility; soil structure; soil stability; and soil erosion * Physical: bulk density, infiltration, soil structure and macropores, soil depth, and water holding capacity => retention and transport of water and nutrients; habitat for soil microbes; estimate of crop productivity potential; compaction, plow pan, water movement; porosity; and tilth * Chemical: electrical conductivity, reactive carbon, soil nitrate, soil pH, and extractable phosphorus and potassium => biological and chemical activity thresholds; plant and microbial activity thresholds; and plant available nutrients and potential for N and P loss * Biological: earthworms, microbial biomass C and N, particulate organic matter, potentially mineralizable N, soil enzymes, soil respiration, and total organic carbon => microbial catalytic potential and repository for C and N; soil productivity and N supplying potential; and microbial activity measure ## Documents Cropland In Field Soil Health Assessment Guide (3.34 MB) Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (9.64 MB) * * * ## Soil Quality Indicator Sheets A series of information sheets for physical, chemical and biological indicators to help conservationists and soil scientists with soil health assessment.

Home 2. Getting Assistance 3. Organic Agriculture 4. NRCS Assistance for Organic Farmers 5. Irrigation and Water Management NRCS can help organic farmers with irrigation water management strategies tailored to their farm’s specific needs. Conservation practices can also protect water quality in the surrounding ecosystem. ## Water Quantity Irrigation management plans combine conservation principles with efficiency, balancing the farm’s water needs with those of nature. Tools like drip irrigation, which provides water precisely where and when it’s needed, can achieve greater precision with flow meters and soil moisture sensors. Farmers can also conserve water by increasing their soil’s water holding capacity and using conservation tillage to keep the ground covered, reducing water loss through transpiration and evaporation. A one percent increase in soil organic matter can help the soil retain an additional 20,000 gallons of water per acre that can be banked and become available when plants need it most. NRCS agricultural engineers can use satellite-tracking tools to conduct precise topographic surveys, then design complete site-specific irrigation systems, from wells to pumps to pipes to hookups out in the field, saving water by improving irrigation efficiency. In combinations, these practices add up and make a huge difference. ## Water Quality Well-managed organic systems rely on slow-release forms of nutrients, which reduce the risk of nutrient runoff and leaching. These practices help maintain water quality, while enhanced soil structure, water infiltration, and better nutrient retention also protect water quality. NRCS-developed nutrient management plans, cover crops, and buffers keep soil and nutrients in place and filter runoff water. ![Image: Wanda Wetlesen-Shepherd, USDA/NRCS, Agricultural Engineer, Athens, GA](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/getting-assistance/other-topics/organic/nrcs- assistance-for-organic- farmers/sites/default/files/styles/quote_callout/public/2022-09/nrcseprd1367234.png?h=854bad7e&itok=sg- AauS8) > I provide technical assistance on any natural resource concern that’s out > there.

Erosion fighting practices include: * Cover crops * No till or reduced till * Crop rotation ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/management- icon.svg) ### Enhance Management Management of use of fertilizers and pesticides to keep them on the field or pasture can reduce costs as well as potential for loss. Water friendly management practices include: * Integrated pest management * Nutrient management * Irrigation water management ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/filtration- icon.svg) ### Improve Filtration In field practice can help reduce runoff, but filtering the runoff to remove sediment, chemicals, and waste can improve downstream water quality. Practices that help filter runoff include: * Filter strip * Riparian forest buffer * Bioreactor ![Image:](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/waste- icon.svg) ### Manage Animal Waste Preventing animal waste from entering water sources is a key way to protect water quality. Practices that manage animal waste include: * Prescribed grazing * Waste storage * Waste management ## Focus on Water Quality ### Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agricultural lands make up nearly 30% of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which includes the District of Columbia and portions of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. This region has more than 83,000 farms responsible for more than $10 billion in agricultural production each year. Between 2018 and 2020, NRCS helped farmers implement conservation on 1.26 million acres in the Bay watershed. That’s the size of Grand Canyon National Park. USDA will invest an additional $22.5 million in conservation assistance in fiscal year 2022 building on a $1.1 billion investment over the past decade.

It accelerates on-farm conservation investments focused on improving water quality where it is most needed. Since 2012, NRCS has worked with more than 6,000 producers to adopt conservation practices on more than 1.37 million acres in priority watersheds through NWQI. At least 19 impaired water bodies have been improved and subsequently scheduled for de-listing or otherwise removed from NWQI due to successful water quality improvements. Learn more about watersheds that are part of NWQI’s current efforts. * * * ### Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative Launched in 2009, the 12-state Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI) helps landowners sustain America’s natural resources through voluntary conservation. States within the Mississippi River Basin have developed nutrient reduction strategies to minimize the contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters within the basin, and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico. MRBI uses a small watershed approach to support the states’ reduction strategies. Avoiding, controlling and trapping practices are implemented to reduce the amount of nutrients flowing from agricultural land into waterways and to improve the resiliency of working lands. These targeted investments have increased the adoption of critical water quality conservation practices, such as cover crops, no-till, residue management, grassed waterways and nutrient management by over 30%. Learn more about MRBI. * * * ### Great Lake Restoration Initiative The Great Lake Restoration Initiative (GLRI) helps NRCS accelerate conservation efforts on private lands located in targeted watersheds throughout the Great Lakes region. Through GLRI, NRCS works with farmers and landowners to combat invasive species, protect watersheds and shorelines from non-point source pollution and restore wetlands and other habitat areas. Practices implemented by farmers working in partnership with NRCS through GLRI have reduced phosphorus by over 1.1 million pounds in target areas since 2010. Learn more about GLRI. * * * ### Additional Approaches In addition to these initiatives, NRCS offers edge-of-field monitoring, which allows producers to measure the effects of conservation work on water quality. This helps farmers make informed decisions about efficiency, economic impacts, and yields. NRCS also supports market-based approaches to improve water quality. ## Water Quality Practices for Working Lands ### Cover Crops The roots of cover crops make channels in the soil that improves its ability to take in water. Cover crops also build soil organic matter, hold soil in place that might otherwise erode, and feed soil organisms that provide valuable nutrients to cash crops during the traditional growing season. ![Image: video duration time](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/time-duration- icon-20.svg) **2 minute video** Remote video URL ### Grassed Waterway Grassed Waterway is a way of repurposing marginal lands to improve filtration of runoff and reduce erosion from farm land. It has the added benefit of creating riparian habitat. ![Image: video duration time](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/sites/default/files/time-duration- icon-20.svg) **2 minute video** Remote video URL ### No Till We’ve learned that most operations do not need heavy tillage – or often any tillage at all – to produce healthy crops. Minimizing tillage can reduce soil erosion across your operation while saving time and money.
